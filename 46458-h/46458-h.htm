</div>

<p class='c007' >“I beg your pardon, but it’s <i>my</i> turn to have
the Egg!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Three pairs of eyes swept to the sunny window
seat from which vantage-ground Sidney Romley
had thrown her protest. Three mouths gaped.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Yours—</i>”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, Sid—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Fifteen-year-olders don’t have turns!” laughed
Victoria Romley, who was nineteen and very
grown up.</p>

<p class='c008' >Though inwardly Sidney writhed, outwardly she
maintained a calm firmness. The better to impress
her point she uncurled herself from the cushions
and straightened to her fullest height.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s because I <i>am</i> fifteen that I am claiming my
rights,” she answered, carefully ignoring Vicky’s
laughing eyes. “Each one of you has had the Egg
twice and I’ve never had a cent of it—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sid, you forget I bought a rug when it was my
last turn and you enjoy that as much as I do,” broke
in her oldest sister.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney waved her hand impatiently. She had
rehearsed this scene in the privacy of her attic retreat
and she could not be deflected by mention of rugs and
things. She must keep to the heart of the issue.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s the principle of the thing,” she continued,
loftily. “We’re always fair with one another and
give and take and all that, and I think it’d be a blot
on our honor if you refused me my lawful turn at the
Egg. I’m willing to overlook each one of you having
it twice.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s kind of you. What would you do with
it, anyway, kid?” interrupted Vicky, quite unimpressed
by her sister’s seriousness. She let a chuckle
in her voice denote how amused she was.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney flashed a withering look in Vicky’s
direction.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I wouldn’t spend it all on one party that’s over
in a minute and nothing to show for it!” she
retorted. Then: “And what I’d do with it is my
own affair!” She swallowed to control a sob that
rose in her throat.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Tut! Tut!” breathed the tormenting Vicky.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, Sid, dear!” cried Trude, astonished.
She put a tray of dishes that she was carrying to the
kitchen down upon the old sideboard and turned to
face Sid. At the tone of her voice Sidney flew to her
and flung her arms about her.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t care—I don’t <i>care</i>! You can laugh at
me but I’m <i>sick</i> of being different. I—I want to do
things like—other girls do. H-have fun—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Over her head Trude’s eyes implored the others
to be gentle. She herself was greatly disturbed.
Even Vicky grew sober. In a twinkling this lanky,
pigtailed little sister seemed to have become an individual
with whom they must reckon. They had
never suspected but that she was as contented with
her happy-go-lucky way as any petted kitten.</p>

<p class='c008' >Isolde, the oldest sister, frowned perplexedly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sidney, stop crying and tell us what you want.
As far as <i>fun</i> is concerned I don’t think you have
any complaint. Certainly you do not have anything
to <i>worry</i> about!” Isolde’s tone conveyed that
she did.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If it’s just the Egg that’s bothering you, why,
take it!” cried Vicky, magnanimously.</p>

<p class='c008' >Only Trude sensed that the cause of Sidney’s
rebellion lay deeper than any desire for fun. She
was not unaware of certain dissatisfactions that
smoldered in her own breast. The knowledge of
them helped her to understand Sidney’s mood. She
patted the girl’s head sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I guess we haven’t realized you’re growing up,
Sid,” she laughed softly. “Now brace up and tell
us what’s wrong with everything.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude’s quiet words poured balm on Sidney’s
soul. At last—at <i>last</i> these three sisters realized she
was fifteen. It <i>hadn’t</i> been the Egg itself she had
wanted—it had been to have them reckon her in on
their absurd family cogitations. She drew the sleeve
of her blouse across her eyes and faced them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I want to go somewhere, to live somewhere
where I won’t be Joseph Romley’s daughter! I want
to wear clothes like the other girls and go to a
boarding school and never set eyes on a book of
poetry. I want adventure and to do exciting things.
I want—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Isolde stemmed the outpour with a shocked
rebuke.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sid, I don’t think you realize how disrespectful
what you are saying is to our father’s memory!
He has left us something that is far greater than
wealth. A great many girls would gladly change
places with you and enjoy being the daughter of
a poet—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, tush!” Quite unexpectedly Sidney found
an ally in Vicky. “Issy, you’ve acted your part so
often, poor dear, that you really think we <i>are</i> blessed
by the gods in having been born to a poet. And poor
as church mice! I wish someone <i>would</i> change places
with me long enough for me to eat a few meals without
hearing you and Trude talk about how much
flour costs and how we’re going to pay the milk bill.
Yes, a <i>fine</i> heritage! Poor Dad, he couldn’t help
being a poet, but I’ll bet he wishes now he’d been a
plasterer or something like that—for <i>our</i> sakes, of
course. I’m not kicking, I’m as game as you are, and
I’m willing to carry on about Dad’s memory and all
that—it’s the least <i>we</i> can do in return for what the
League’s done for us, but just among ourselves we
might enjoy the emotion of sighing for the things
other girls do and have, mightn’t we?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney had certainly started something! The
very atmosphere of the familiar room in which they
were assembled seemed charged with strange currents.
Never had any family council taken such a
tone. Sidney thrilled to the knowledge that she was
now a vital part of it. Her eyes, so recently wet,
brightened and her cheeks flushed. So interested
was she in what Issy would answer to Vick that she
ignored the opening Vick had made for her.</p>

<p class='c008' >But it was Trude who answered Vicky—Trude,
the peaceful.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Come! Come! First thing we know we’ll
actually be feeling sorry for ourselves! I sometimes
get awfully tired living up to Dad’s greatness, but
I don’t think that’s being disrespectful to his memory.
I don’t suppose there are any girls, even rich ones,
who don’t sigh for something they haven’t. But just
to stiffen our spines let’s sum up our assets. We’re
not quite as poor as church mice; we have this old
house that isn’t half bad, even if the roof does leak,
and the government bonds and the royalties and
living the way we had to live with Dad taught us to
have fun among ourselves which is something!
We’re not dependent upon outsiders for <i>that</i>. You,
Issy, have your personality which will get you
anywhere you want to go. And Vick’s better dressed on
nothing than any girl in Middletown. We older girls
do have a little more than Sid, so I vote she has the
Egg this time all to herself to do exactly as she
pleases with it—go ’round the world in search of
adventure or any old thing. How’s that, family?”</p>

<p class='c008' >The tension that had held the little circle broke
under Trude’s practical cheeriness. Isolde smiled.
Vick liked being told she looked well-dressed, she
worked hard enough to merit that distinction. Sid
had the promise of the Egg, which, be it known, was
the royalty accruing each year from a collection of
whimsical verse entitled “Goosefeathers” and which
these absurd daughters of a great but improvident
man set aside from the other royalties to be spent
prodigally by each in turn.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m quite willing,” Isolde conceded. “I was
going to suggest that we agree to use it this time to
fix the roof where it leaks but if Sid’s heart is set
on it—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It would have been my turn—that is not counting
Sid,” Vick reminded them, “and I’d have used
it having that fur coat Godmother Jocelyn sent
me made over. But let the roof leak and the coat
go—little Sid must have her fling! I hope you’re
happy now, kid. What will you really do with all
that money?”</p>

<p class='c008' >At no time had Sidney definitely considered such
a question. Her point won she found herself embarrassed
by victory. She evaded a direct answer.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I won’t tell, now!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh—ho, mysterious! Well, there won’t be so
much that you’ll hurt yourself in your youthful extravagance.
Now that this momentous <i>affaire de
famille</i> is settled, what are you girls going to do
this morning?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“As soon as these dishes are out of the way
I’m going to trim that vine on the front wall. It’s
disgustingly scraggly.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Trude—you <i>can’t</i>! You forget—<i>it’s
Saturday</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude groaned. Vicky laughed naughtily.
Saturday—that was the day of the week which the
Middletown Branch of the League of American
Poets kept for the privilege of taking visitors to the
home of Joseph Romley, the poet. In a little while
they would begin to come, in twos and threes and
larger groups. First they’d stand outside and look
at the old house from every angle. They would say
to the strangers who were visiting the shrine for
the first time: “No, the house wasn’t in his family
but Joseph Romley made it peculiarly his; it’s as
though his ancestors had lived there for generations—nothing
has been changed—that west room with
the bay window was his study—yes, his desk is
there and his pencils and pens—just as he left them—even
his old house jacket—of course we can go
in—our League paid off the mortgage as a memorial
and we have Saturday as a visiting day—there are
four girls, most interesting types, but Isolde, the
oldest, is the only one of them who is at all like the
great poet—”</p>

<p class='c008' >They would come in slowly, reverently. Isolde,
in a straight smock of some vivid color, with a fillet
about the cloudy hair that framed her thin face like
a curtain, would meet them at the door of the study.
She would shake hands with them and answer their
awkward questions in her slow drawl which always
ended in a minor note. They would look at Isolde
much more closely than at the desk and the pens
and pencils and the old swivel chair and the faded
cushion. On their way out they’d peep inquisitively
into the front room with its long windows, bared to
the light and the floor looking dustier for the new
rug, and the two faded, deep chairs near the old
piano. They would see the dust and the bareness
but they wouldn’t know how gloriously, at sunset
time, the flame of the sky lighted every corner of
the spacious room or what jolly fires could crackle
on the deep hearth or what fun it was to cuddle in
the old chairs—they could hold four—while Vicky’s
clever fingers raced over the cracked ivory keys in
her improvisations that sometimes set them roaring
with laughter and sometimes brought mist to
their eyes. The intruders would find some way to
look into the dining room which for the girls was
living room and sewing room, too, and they’d say:
“How quaint everything is! These old houses have
<i>so</i> much atmosphere;” when in their hearts they’d be
thinking about the shabbiness of everything and
they’d be rejoicing that <i>their</i> fathers and husbands
were not poets! Vicky claimed to have heard one
sacrilegious young creature, plainly on a honeymoon,
exclaim: “I’m glad I’m not a poet’s daughter and
have to live in that old sepulcher! Give me obscurity
in a steam-heated three bathroom apartment,
any day!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Of course there could be no trimming the vines
and Trude’s fingers itched for the task—not so
much that she minded the unkempt growth as that
she longed to be active out-of-doors. She had planned
to plant another row of beans, too. The
girls wouldn’t poke fun at her when they ate fresh
vegetables right out of a garden all of their own!
But the ladies of the League must not find her, earth-stained
and disheveled, in the garden on Saturday!</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll have to change my dress. I forgot it was
Saturday when I put this old thing on.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Vick, dear, you haven’t taken your sketching
things from Dad’s desk,” admonished Isolde a little
frightenedly and Vicky jumped with a low whistle.
“Good gracious! What if a High Lady Leaguer
found <i>my</i> truck on that sacred shrine!” She rushed
off to the study.</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude having gone kitchenward with her dishes,
Isolde and Sidney faced one another. Sidney grew
awkwardly aware of a constraint in her sister’s manner.
She was regarding her with a curious hardness
in her grave eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You said you were sick of being different!”
Isolde made Sidney’s words sound childish. “Well—I
don’t know just how you can escape it—any
more than the rest of us can. Look at me—look at
Trude—” Then she shut her lips abruptly over
what she had started to say. “What had you planned
to do this morning, Sid?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I told Nancy Stevens I’d go swimming with her
though I don’t much care whether I go or not.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well—as long as you <i>have</i> claimed a share in
our little scheme of life, kitten—perhaps <i>you’d</i> better
receive the League visitors this morning. I have
some letters to write and I want to dye that old
silk. Don’t forget to enter the date in the register!”</p>

<p class='c008' >With which astounding command Isolde walked
slowly out of the room leaving Sidney with a baffled
sense of—in spite of the promise of the Egg—having
been robbed of something.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c006'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />REBELLION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Not the least of the dissatisfactions that had
grown in Sidney’s breast was belonging to an Estate.</p>

<p class='c008' >Since the death of Joseph Romley four years
earlier, the royalties from his published verse and
the government bonds and the oil stock, that had
never paid any dividend but might any year, and the
four young daughters were managed by two trustees
who had been college friends of the poet and who,
even in his lifetime, had managed what of his affairs
had had any managing. One was a banker and one
was a lawyer and they lived in New York, making
only rare visits to Middletown. They considered it
far better for Isolde and Trude to visit them twice
a year and to such an arrangement both older girls
were quite agreeable.</p>

<p class='c008' >But Sidney, knowing the Trustees only as two
brusque busy men who talked rapidly and called her
“mouse” and “youngster” and brought her childish
presents and huge boxes of candy which never
contained her favorite chocolate alligators, found
them embarrassingly lacking in the dramatic qualities
a “guardian,” to be of any value to a girl, should
possess. Nor did they ever bother their heads in
the least as to what <i>she</i> did or didn’t do! In fact
no one did. There seemed to be only one law that
controlled her and everything in the big old house—what
one could <i>afford</i> to do! She disliked the word.</p>

<p class='c008' >She resented, too, the Middletown Branch of the
League of American Poets. This was a band of
women and a scattering of men who had pledged to
foster the art of verse-making; a few of them really
wrote poetry, a few more understood it, the greater
number belonged to the League as Associates. Before
Joseph Romley’s death Sidney had thought them only
very funny because her father and Trude and Isolde
thought them funny. There had been then a great
timidity in their approach. They had seemed to
tremble in their adoring gratitude for a hastily
scrawled autograph; they had sometimes knocked at
the back door and with deep apologies asked if they
might slip in <i>very</i> quietly and take a time exposure
of THE desk where Joseph Romley worked. They
brought senseless gifts which they left unobtrusively
on the piano or the hall rack. They dragged their
own daughters to the old house for awkwardly formal
calls upon Isolde and Trude. But after her
father’s death even Sidney realized that the League
ladies were different. They were not shy any more,
they swooped down upon the little household and
cleaned and baked and sewed and “deared” the
four girls, actually almost living in the house. Isolde
and Trude had made no protest and had gone around
with troubled faces and had talked far into the nights
in the bed which they shared. Then one morning
at breakfast Isolde had announced: “The League
has paid the mortgage on this house so that we can
keep our home here. It is very good of them—I’m
sure I don’t know where we could have gone.
We must show them how grateful we are.” And
Sidney had come to know, by example and the rebukes
cast her way by Isolde, that “showing them”
meant living, not as <i>they</i> might want to live—but as
the League expected the four daughters of a great
poet to live. <i>That</i> was the price for the mortgage.
The League wanted to say possessively: “This is
Joseph Romley’s second daughter” or “That is our
lamb who was only ten months old when the poor
mother died. I am sure the great man would not
have known what to do if it had not been for old
Huldah Mueller who stayed on and took care of
the house and the children for him. He wrote a
sonnet to Huldah once. It was worth a month’s
wages to the woman—” And the League had bought
its right to that possessive tone. Sidney, when Isolde
could not see, indulged in naughty faces behind stout
Mrs. Milliken’s back and confided to her chum,
Nancy Stevens, the story of how Dad had once, in
a rage of impatience, called down to the adoring Mrs.
Milliken, waiting in the hall for an autograph:
“Madam, if you don’t go off at once and leave me
alone I’ll come down to you in my pajamas! I tell
you I’ve gone to bed.” Oh, Mrs. Milliken had fled
<i>then</i>!</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney had to go to Miss Downs’ stupid private
day school when she would have preferred the
Middletown High (as long as she could not go away
to a boarding school), simply because Miss Downs
was one of the directors of the League and gave her
her tuition as a scholarship.</p>

<p class='c008' >But Sidney had never thought—until Isolde had
spoken so strangely a moment before—that her
sisters minded either the Trustees or the League or
having to be “different.” Isolde naturally was everything
the League wanted her to be, with her grave
eyes and her cloudy hair with the becoming fillets
and her drawling voice and her clever smocks. Trude
always wanted to oblige everyone anyway, and Vicky
was so pretty that it didn’t make any difference what
she did. Sidney had considered that she was alone
in her rebellion, a rebellion that had flamed in her
outburst of the morning: “I’m <i>sick</i> of being
different!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Isolde’s words of a moment before, with their
hard hint of some portentous meaning, started a
train of thought now in Sidney’s mind that drove
away all joy in the promise of the next Egg, that
made her even forget her dislike of the duty Isolde
had so unexpectedly put upon her. Isolde had said
distinctly: “You can’t get away from it—look at <i>me</i>—look
at <i>Trude</i>!” And it had sounded queer,
bitter, as though somewhere down deep in her Isolde
nursed an unhappy feeling about something. Sidney
pondered, lingering in the deserted dining room.
Maybe, after all, Isolde did not like being the daughter
of a poet and her smocks and her fillets
and all the luncheons and teas to which she had to
go and the speeches of appreciation she had to make.
And what did Trude dislike? She always <i>seemed</i>
happy but maybe <i>she</i> wanted something. Sidney
remembered once hearing Trude cry terribly hard in
the study. She and Dad had been talking at dinner
about college. They had come to the door of the
study and Dad had said: “It can’t be done, sonny.”
That’s what Dad had always called Trude because
she was the boy of the family. Trude had come
out with her face all shiny with tears and her father
had stood on the threshold of the door with his hair
rumpled and his nose twitching the way it did when
something bothered him. That was probably it.
Trude had wanted college. That seemed silly to
Sidney who hated lessons, at least the kind Miss
Downs gave, but it was too bad to have good old
Trude, who was such a peach, want anything.</p>

<p class='c008' >Isolde hadn’t included Vicky, but then Vicky
<i>couldn’t</i> want anything. She wasn’t afraid to fly
in the faces of the Trustees and the whole League
and they wouldn’t mind if she did. She was as clever
as she was pretty. She could take the old dresses
which Mrs. Custer and Mrs. White, the Trustees’
wives, and Mrs. Deering whom Isolde had visited in
Chicago, and Godmother Jocelyn sent every now
and then and make the stunningest new dresses. And
once an artist from New York had painted her portrait
and exhibited it in Paris and had won a medal
for it. The League ladies approved of that and
always told of it.</p>

<p class='c008' >Vicky had whole processions of beaux who came
and crowded in the chairs in the front room or sat
on the broad window sills of the open windows smoking
while she talked to them or played for them.
Isolde’s few beaux were not noisy and jolly like
Vick’s—they all looked as though the League might
have picked them out from some assortment. They
usually read to Isolde verses of their own or made
her read them some of Dad’s. Maybe, Sidney’s
thoughts shot out at a new angle—maybe Isolde did
not like beaux who were poets, liked Vick’s kind of
men better.</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude had only one beau and Sidney had never
seen him because Trude had had him when she was
visiting Aunt Edith White. Trude and Isolde had
whispered a great deal about him and Trude had let
Isolde read his letters. Then a letter had come that
had made Trude look all queer and white and Isolde,
after she had read it, had gone to Trude and put her
arms around her neck and Isolde only did a thing
like that when something dreadful happened. Sidney
had hoped that she might find the letter lying around
somewhere so carelessly that she could be pardoned
for reading it, but though she had looked everywhere
she had never found it. She had had to piece
together Trude’s romance from the fabric of her agile
imagination.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney had often tried to make herself hate the
old house. Though it was a jolly, rambly place it
was so very down-at-the heels and the light that
poured in through the windows made things look
even barer and shabbier. Nancy Stevens lived in
one of the new bungalows near the school and it was
beautiful with shiny furniture and rugs that felt
like woolly bed slippers under one’s tread and two
pairs of curtains at each window and Nancy’s own
room was all pink even to the ruffled stuff hung over
her bed like a tent. But Sidney had once heard Mrs.
Milliken say to Isolde: “I hope, dear girl, that you
will not be tempted to change this fine old house in
<i>any</i> way—to leave it just as your father lived in it
is the greatest tribute we can pay to his memory.”
After that Sidney knew there was no use hinting
for even <i>one</i> pair of curtains. But her sisters had
seemed quite contented.</p>

<p class='c008' >There had been a disturbing ring of finality to
Isolde’s, “You can’t get away from it,” that seemed
almost to slap Sidney in the face. Would they <i>always</i>—at
least she and Isolde and Trude, Vick would
manage to escape someway—be bound down there in
the “quaint” bare house with the Trustees sending
their skimpy allowances and long letters of advice and
the ladies of the League of Poets coming and going
and owning them body and soul? What was to prevent
such a fate? They didn’t have money enough
to just say—“Dear ladies, take the old house and
the desk and the pens and pencils and the old coat—they’re
yours—” and run away and do what they
pleased; probably a whole dozen of Eggs would not
get them anywhere!</p>

<p class='c008' >“What are you doing mooning there in the window?”
cried Vick from the open door. Her arms
were filled with a litter of boxes and old portfolios.
“Where’s Isolde? I want her to know I dusted
things in the study.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Isolde’s writing letters. Then she’s going to
dye something.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“On Saturday!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes. <i>I’m</i> going to receive the League visitors
today.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You!” Victoria went off into such a peal of
laughter that she had to lean against the door frame.
“Oh—how funny! What’s <i>ever</i> in the air today.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t know why it’s so funny. I’m—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Fifteen. So you are. But bless me, child, the
Leaguers will never accept you in a middy blouse
and pigtails. What’s Isolde <i>thinking</i> of? And
you look <i>much</i> too plump! Now—” But Sidney
stalked haughtily past her tormenter into the hall.</p>

<p class='c008' >Vick’s bantering, however, had stung her. The
old clock on the stair landing chiming out the
approaching hour of the League visitors warned
Sidney that there was not time to change her middy
with its faded collar; nor to wind the despised pigtails,
around her head in the fashion Mrs. Milliken
called “So beautifully quaint.” Anyway, if there
were all the time in the world she would not do it.
She’d begin right now being her own self and not
something the League wanted her to be because she
was a poet’s daughter! Isolde and Trude might
yield weakly to their fate but she would be strong.
Perhaps, some day, she would rescue them—even
Vicky!</p>

<p class='c008' >But as an unmistakable wave of chattering from
without struck her ear her fine defiance deserted her.
She ran to the door and peeped through one of the
narrow windows that framed the door on either side.</p>

<p class='c008' >At the gate stood Mrs. Milliken and a strange
woman. Behind them, in twos, stretched a long
queue of girls—girls of about her own age. They
wore trim serge dresses with white collars, all alike.
They carried notebooks in their hands. They leaned
toward one another, whispering, giggling.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney’s heart gave a tremendous bound. It was
most certainly a boarding school! It was the nearest
she had ever been to one! She forgot her middy
and the hated pigtails, and the dread of the League.
She threw open the door. Mrs. Milliken’s voice
came to her: “He died on April tenth, Nineteen
eighteen. He had just written that sonnet to the
West Wind. You know it I am sure. He bought
this house when he came to Middletown but he made
it his as though he’d lived in it all his life—we have
left it <i>exactly</i> as it was when he was with us—our
committee——”</p>

<p class='c008' >They came walking slowly toward the house,
Mrs. Milliken and the strange woman with reverent
mien, the wriggling queue still whispering and
giggling.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />POLA LIFTS A CURTAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“Where <i>is</i> Isolde?” Mrs. Milliken whispered
between her “Note the gracious proportions of this
hall” and “Joseph Romley would never allow himself
to be crowded with possessions.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“She’s—she’s—” Sidney had a sudden instinct
to protect Isolde. “She has—a headache.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I am <i>so</i> sorry that I cannot introduce you to
Isolde Romley—the poet’s oldest daughter,” Mrs.
Milliken pitched her voice so that it might reach even
to the girls crowding into the front door. “She is
a <i>most</i> interesting and delightful and unusual young
lady. She was always closely associated with her
gifted father and we feel that she is growing to be
very like him. <i>This</i>—” smiling affectionately at
Sidney and allowing a suggestion of apology to creep
into her tone, “This is just our little Sidney, the
poet’s baby-girl. Sidney, lamb, this is Miss Byers
of Grace Hall, a boarding school for young ladies
and these are her precious charges. They are making
a pilgrimage to our beloved shrine—” Sidney, too
familiar with Mrs. Milliken’s flowery phrases to be
embarrassed by them, faced a little frightenedly the
eyes that stared curiously at her from above the
spotless collars.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We will go right into the study,” Mrs. Milliken
advised Miss Byers. “We can take the girls in
in little groups. As poor Isolde is not here I will
tell them some of the precious and personal anecdotes
of the great poet. You know we, in Middletown—especially
of the League—feel very privileged
to have lived so close to him—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Miss Byers briskly marshalled the first eight girls
into the small study. The others broke file and
crowded into the front room and on to the stairs,
some even spilled over into the dining room. They
paid not the slightest attention to anything about
them. Assured that Miss Byers was out of hearing
they burst into excited chatter and laughter. Except
for one or two who smiled shyly at her they did not
even notice Sidney.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney, relieved that Mrs. Milliken did not expect
<i>her</i> to recite the “precious and personal anecdotes,”
drew back into a corner from where she could enjoy
to its fullest measure the delight of such close propinquity
to real boarding-school girls. Their talk,
broken by smothered shrieks of laughter, rang like
sweetest music to her. They seemed so jolly. Their
blue serges and white collars were so stylish. She
wondered where they all came from and whether
they had “scrapes” at Grace Hall.</p>

<p class='c008' >The first eight girls filed back into the hall from
the study and Miss Byers motioned eight more to
enter. There was a general stirring, then the chatter
swelled again. Presently a girl slipped into Sidney’s
corner and dropped down upon a chair.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Isn’t this the <i>stupidest</i> bore!” she groaned.
Then looking at Sidney, she gasped and laughed.
“Say—I <i>beg</i> your pardon. I thought you were one of
the girls. And you’re—you’re—the poet’s daughter,
aren’t you?” The slanting dove-gray eyes above
the white collar actually softened with sympathy.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney thought this young creature the very
prettiest girl—next to Vicky—she had ever seen.
She did not mind her pity. The stranger had taken
her for “one of the girls” and Sidney would have
forgiven her anything for that!</p>

<p class='c008' >“I suppose it is a bore. Isn’t it fun, though,
just going places?”</p>

<p class='c008' >The boarding school girl stared. “Oh, we go so
<i>much</i>. There isn’t a big gun anywhere within a
radius of five hundred miles that we don’t have to
visit. We get autographs and listen to speeches and
make notes about graves and look at pictures. Most
of the girls get a kick out of it slipping in some gore
behind Byers’ back—but I don’t. I travel so much
with my family that nothing seems awfully exciting
now.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney wished she’d say that over again—it
sounded so unbelievable. And the girl couldn’t be
any older than she was. She was conscious that the
slanting eyes were regarding her closely.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Do you like living here and having a lot of
people tramp all over your house and stare at you
and say things about you and poke at your father’s
things?”</p>

<p class='c008' >It was plain magic the way this stranger put her
finger directly upon the sore spot.</p>

<p class='c008' >“No, I don’t!” vehemently.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>I’d</i> hate it, too. And I suppose you always
have to act like a poet’s daughter, don’t you? Do
you have to write poetry yourself?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“No, I loathe poetry!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But I’ll bet you don’t dare say so when that
Dame in there can hear you! I have to be careful
talking about candy. My father makes the Betty
Sweets. Don’t you know them? They’re sold all
over the world. We have an immense factory. And
there isn’t any other kind of candy that I don’t like
better. But I don’t dare tell anybody that. Funny,
I’m telling you! Our spirits must be drawn together
by some invisible bond.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney’s ears fairly ached with the beauty of the
other’s words. She stiffened her slender little body
to control its trembling. She tried to say something
but found her throat choked. The other girl
rattled on:</p>

<p class='c008' >“I didn’t take any notes. I’ll copy my roommate’s.
You see we have to write a theme about our
visit. Miss Byers prides herself on the girls of Grace
being so well-informed. I know. I’ll put you into it.
That’ll be fun. Only you’ll have to tell me something
about yourself. How old are you? Do you go to a
regular school and play with other girls like any
ordinary girl?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney flushed at the other’s manner and found
her tongue in an instinctive desire to defend her lot.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Of course I go to school. It’s sort of a boarding
school, only all the girls go home nights. And I
do everything the others do. And I am fifteen.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I didn’t mean to offend you. I thought perhaps
a poet’s daughter was different. If you don’t
mind in my theme I’ll <i>make</i> you different—pale and
thin, with curly hair in a cloud, and faraway eyes—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s like Isolde, my oldest sister, the one who
usually tells the ‘precious and personal anecdotes.’
I wasn’t really offended—and I’ll admit most of the
girls do treat me a little bit differently—but that’s
Miss Downs’ fault; she won’t let them forget that I
am Joseph Romley’s daughter. She uses it all the
time in her catalogue and when any visitors come to
the school it’s dreadful—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“If you don’t like it why don’t you come to
Grace Hall? We’d have no end of fun—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gracious, I’ve never been <i>any</i>where. I only go
to Miss Downs’ because it’s here at Middletown and
because she gives me my tuition on account of
Dad—” Sidney bit off her words in a sudden panic
lest her admission of poverty shock this lovely creature.
It had not, however. The dove-gray eyes had
softened again with pity.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, I see. Of course, poets are always poor.
I supposed they usually lived in garrets. I nearly
flopped when I saw this big house!” This to comfort
Sidney. “Well, it’s too bad you <i>can’t</i> go to
Grace. I like the riding best. I have my own horse.
Gypsy. She’s a darling. My roommate is the cutest
thing. She’s captain of the hockey team and her
picture was in the <i>New York Times</i>. Her mother
made a dreadful fuss about it but it was too late.
And she got a letter from a boy in New York who’d
seen the picture—the most exciting letter—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, <i>here</i> you are, Pola,” cried a voice behind
them and a tall girl elbowed Sidney back into her
corner. “Say, Byers will be here at least a half an
hour longer. We’ll have time for a dope at that store
we passed, if we hurry!”</p>

<p class='c008' >All boredom vanished, the girl Pola sprang to
her feet. She paused only long enough to hold out
her hand to Sidney. “Don’t tell anyone that I don’t
like Betty Sweets best of all the candy in the world,
will you?” she laughed. “And I won’t tell anyone
that you loathe poetry.” Then she ran after the tall
girl. Sidney felt engulfed in a great and terrible
loneliness.</p>

<p class='c008' >For the next half hour she was only conscious
of a fear that Pola and her companion might not
get back before Miss Byers discovered their flight.
But just as the last eight came out of the study and
Miss Byers was lingering for a few words with Mrs.
Milliken, Sidney saw two flying figures join the
others at the gate. Her little hope that she might
have a chance to talk again with Pola or hear her
talk was lost in a surge of relief that she was
quite safe.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mrs. Milliken remained after the others had filed
down the street. Sidney, troubled by her fib of the
headache, wished with all her soul that she would go
and strained her ears for any sound from the floor
above that might betray Isolde’s activities.</p>

<p class='c008' >“A lovely thing—to bring those young girls to
this spot,” Mrs. Milliken was murmuring as she
looked over the register which the League kept very
carefully. “Here are some well-known names. Jenkins—probably
that’s the iron family. Scott—I wonder
if that’s the Scott who’s related to the Astors.”
Sidney watched the gloved finger as it traced its
way down the page of scrawled signatures.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Is there a Pola Somebody there?” she asked,
hopefully. Mrs. Milliken’s finger ran back up the
page.</p>

<p class='c008' >“No—not that I can find. The girls were very
careless—not half of them registered.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Of course Pola wouldn’t have registered—she
had been too bored.</p>

<p class='c008' >Her survey finished, Mrs. Milliken put the
register in its place and regarded Sidney with contemplative
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Another time, dear lamb, if you receive, tell
Isolde to—well, fix you up a little. I must speak to
the Committee and plan something suitable for you.
Perhaps we have been forgetting that our dear little
girl is growing out of her rompers. Oh—and another
thing, tell Isolde I was <i>shocked</i> to smell gasoline on
your gifted father’s jacket—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Trude thought it had moths in it and she soaked
it in gasoline,” explained Sidney uncomfortably.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, she <i>mustn’t</i> do it again. It—it spoiled the
atmosphere of everything! I will speak to the dear
girls. Give my love to Isolde and tell her to rest.
I do not think anyone else will come today for I
posted a notice at the clubrooms reserving this date
for Grace School.”</p>

<p class='c008' >With an affectionate leave-taking of her “lamb”
Mrs. Milliken rustled off. Sidney slowly shut the
door. Out there, beyond the hedge, went Pola and
the other laughing girls of Grace Hall, out into a
world of fun and adventure. And <i>inside</i> the door—</p>

<p class='c008' >Pola had dared race off to the corner drug store;
Sidney felt certain Pola would dare <i>anything</i>. And
<i>she</i> had not even had spunk enough to speak up and
tell interfering Mrs. Milliken that Trude and the
rest of them would soak everything in gasoline, if
they wanted to! Most certainly they were not going
to let <i>moths</i> eat them all up alive!</p>

<p class='c008' >Oh—oh, it was hateful! And Isolde had said
they could not escape it; well, she’d <i>find</i> a way!</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008' >From abovestairs the three older sisters had witnessed
the invasion of their home by the Grace Hall
girls.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s perfectly disgusting!” had been Vick’s
comment.</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude was all sympathy for Sidney. “You were
cruel, Issy, making Sid receive that mob.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Isolde reluctantly turned her attention from the
faded silks in her lap.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sidney might as well realize with what <i>we</i>
have to put up. Then perhaps she will not be so discontented
with her own easy lot—”</p>

<p class='c008' >From where she squatted on the floor, a huge
mending basket balanced on her knees, Trude
regarded Isolde with troubled eyes. Her forehead
puckered with little criss-cross wrinkles. Of the three
older girls Trude had the least claim to beauty;
from constant exposure her skin had acquired a
ruddiness like a boy’s which made her blue eyes paler
by contrast; her hair had been cut after an attack of
scarlet fever and had grown in so slowly that she
wore it shingle-bobbed which added to the suggestion
of boyishness about her; there was an ungirlish
sturdiness and squareness to her build—one instinctively
looked to her shoulders to carry burdens. Yet
withal there was about her a lovableness infinitely
more winning than Vick’s Grecian beauty or Isolde’s
interesting personality—a lovableness and a loyalty
that urged her on now to champion poor Sidney and
yet made it the harder for her to express to the
others what she felt deep in her heart.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Stop a minute and think, Issy. Didn’t <i>we</i> used
to feel discontented lots of times and fuss about
things between ourselves? We knew—though we
didn’t exactly ever <i>say</i> it—that we <i>had</i> to be different,
on account of Dad. We couldn’t ever bother him,
for fear we’d spoil his work. Of course it was all
worth while and doesn’t make much difference—now,
but, Issy, <i>Sid</i> doesn’t have to put up with what we did—”
Trude stopped suddenly. It seemed dreadful
to say: “Dad isn’t writing any poems now.” She
felt the pang of loss in her tender heart that always
came when she thought of her father, with his bursts
of impatience and his twitching nose and his long
hours in the study with the door closed, and then his
great indulgence and boyish demonstrativeness when
some work that had been tormenting was completed
and off or when some unexpected acceptance came
with an accompanying check. She blinked back some
tears. “You know I wouldn’t talk like this to anyone
outside of us, but, just among us—I wish we could
let Sidney do the things we didn’t do when we were
her age.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Trude, I have never heard you talk so foolishly.
I’m sure our lot isn’t so tragic that Sid can’t share it.
She has nice friends and goes to Miss Downs and
hasn’t a responsibility in the world—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sometimes we get tired of the brand of our
best friends and want a change—even yearn for
responsibility!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’d say we’d spoiled her enough—she doesn’t
need any more.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Isolde, you simply don’t want to understand
me! Goodness knows I preach contentment the loudest—but—
Are we going to live like this all our
lives? Look at us, huddled up here, now, because the
Saturdays belong to the League. Issy, you and I
can go on because we got broken in to it years ago.
Vick won’t, of course—” (flashing a smile at the
disinterested Victoria) “but little Sid—She’s fifteen
now. She has two more years at Miss Downs’.
She may want college—or—or something—different——”</p>

<p class='c008' >Isolde lifted her shoulders with an impatient
shrug. Isolde’s thin shoulders were very expressive
and had a way of communicating her thoughts more
effectively than mere words. They silenced Trude,
now.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Do you think it’s a kindness to encourage Sid
to want things that we simply can’t afford to give
her? You ought to know that we can’t live a bit
differently—you keep our accounts.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude groaned. In any argument they always
came back to that; their poverty was like the old
wall outside that closed them around. If poor little
Sid dreamed dreams it would be as it had been with
her. Isolde was quite right—it might be no kindness
to the child to let her want things—like college. Yet,
though silenced, Trude was not satisfied; there were
surely things one could want that could surmount
even the ugly wall of poverty.</p>

<p class='c008' >Vick broke into the pause.</p>

<p class='c008' >“While we’re considering Sid, what are we
going to do with her this summer? If she’s going
to have fits like she had this morning it’ll be pleasant
having her round with nothing to do. Of course if
Godmother Jocelyn makes good on her promise to
take me to Banff <i>I</i> won’t have to worry but—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Trude, have you written to Huldah asking her
if she can come for July and August? Prof. Deering
wrote last week suggesting that I spend the summer
with them in their cottage on Lake Michigan. I can
more than pay my board by helping Professor Deering
with his book and that will relieve Mrs. Deering
so that she can play with the children. It will be a
change for me—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Some change, I’d say,” laughed Vicky. “A
crabby professor and an overworked wife and two
crying babies—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Professor Deering <i>isn’t</i> crabbed at all, Vick;
he’s a dear and the babies are adorable and Mrs.
Deering wrote that the bungalow is right on the
water and that she’s going to reduce the housework
to almost nothing.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It would be nice, Isolde. Why hadn’t you told
us of the plan? I had better postpone going to
New York. Aunt Edith White will invite me some
other time.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You mustn’t do anything of the sort,” remonstrated
Isolde quickly. “If you do I’ll write to Mrs.
Deering and tell her I cannot come. You didn’t go
to New York at Easter when Aunt Edith White
invited you and she may think you don’t like to go.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It seems terribly selfish for us to go away and
leave Sid with Huldah in this lonely old house.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“She adores Huldah and she has her chums—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“And she’ll have the Egg to spend—” from Vick.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But there’s such a sameness. And the League
brings so many more people—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Trude, you’re positively silly about Sid. When
we were fifteen—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just the same, I don’t want to be the one to tell
her the three of us are going away to have a good
time and leave her here with Huldah all summer—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll tell her,” declared Isolde, firmly. “And
I’ll try to make her understand she is very well off.
Sidney really owes more to the League than the rest
of us do for we <i>could</i> take care of ourselves. I think
we ought to make her appreciate that fact. Vick,
look out, quick! Did I hear Mrs. Milliken saying
goodby?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes, there she goes!” cried Vick, now boldly
at the window. “What luck to be free so early. Let’s
see how much is left of poor old Sid.”</p>

<p class='c008' >But Vick, opening the door, saw a very straight,
pigtailed figure walk resolutely down the long hall
toward the attic stairs. Her quick “Well, kid, how
did it go?” fell upon deaf ears, nor did Sidney so
much as glance in her direction.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c006'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />SIDNEY DIGS FOR COUSINS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >The Romley house stood two stories and a half
high, heavy-beamed, thick-walled, of square spacious
rooms with deep-set windows and cavernous fireplaces
under low marble mantels. Joseph Romley had
chosen it because he said it was so big a man could
think in it; he liked the seclusion, too, that the surrounding
wall promised. If his wife faltered before
the care it presented she had given no sign but had
bravely spread their limited possessions through some
of the rooms and had sensibly closed off others.</p>

<p class='c008' >There had never been a time since the Romleys
took possession when the house had not needed painting
and shingling, when the guarding wall was not
crumbling and the gate swinging on one hinge, when
the furnace was not needing cleaning and the plumbing
overhauling. But the wind sang cheerily down
the great chimneys and the sun poured in through the
windows and the ancient elms housed hosts of birds
and the hollyhocks bloomed early and late against the
wall so that Joseph Romley knew only the beauty of
the place and was content and his family, perforce,
was content because he was.</p>

<p class='c008' >There had never been enough of the fine old furniture
Mrs. Romley had collected in her bridehood
to furnish a separate room for each one of the girls.
Isolde and Trude had always shared a sunny room
over the study. In a back room Victoria and Sidney
still used the narrow beds of nursery days. Only
lately Victoria had painted them gray with a trim
of pink rose buds but the effect had suffered so sharply
from Sidney’s “truck” that Sidney had been coerced
into taking her precious belongings to the attic where
she established a kingdom of her own.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was a beautiful attic. Its rafters, shiny and
brown, were so low that Sidney, by standing very
straight, could touch them with the top of her head.
It had mysterious crannies and shadowy corners and
deep dusty holes. Sidney had walled off one end by
piling one trunk upon another and pushing an old
wardrobe next to them. There she had her possessions,
a flat-topped desk with long wobbly legs which
she reached by a box balanced on an old stool, the
skeleton of a sofa on which sat five dusty and neglected
dolls, a scrap of carpeting, amazing as to red
roses but sadly frayed about its edges, one boastful
rocker in complete possession of arms and legs, which
Trude had smuggled up to her, and a conglomeration
of her favorite books scattered everywhere, for in the
seclusion of the attic she could pore over them without
risk of some Lady Leaguer discovering her love
of them.</p>

<p class='c008' >To this sanctuary Sidney retreated now from
Vick and the Leaguers and her luckless lot.
Swinging open the door of the wardrobe so as to shut off
any unannounced approach to her den, she tiptoed to
a corner, knelt down and cautiously lifted a board
from the floor, thereby revealing a space two feet
square between the beams.</p>

<p class='c008' >From among the treasures concealed there she
drew out an old ledger on the first page of which
was printed in large type: “Dorothea, friend and
confidante of Sidney Romley.” Jerking herself
closer to the window she opened the book across her
knees and began to write in it with the stub of a pencil
she extracted from the pocket of her middy blouse.</p>

<p class='c010' >“Dearest Dorothea:</p>

<p class='c011' >“Today I stand at a crossroad of life. I am
fifteen. It is not my birthday for I had my birthday
as you will see if you turn back to page 64 but I
am fifteen today in the eyes of the world for I have
come into my legal and just rights. I am to have
the next Egg. I had to make a scene before I got
them to promise I could have it but it was ever thus
with rights. I swear solemnly now to you, dear
Dorothea, that I shall never cry again in front of
Victoria Romley. Never. I hate her when she
laughs. I do not hate Isolde even though she does
not understand me and that is hard. And I adore
Trude as I have told you on many other pages. However,
I am to have the Egg.</p>

<p class='c011' >“But that is not all that happened this morning.
I have talked to the most beautiful girl I ever saw.
Her name is Pola and she goes to Grace Hall, which
is a boarding school for very rich girls who have
horses. Her father makes candy in a big factory
and it is sold all over the world. When I get the
Egg I shall buy a great deal of Betty Sweets. That
is it. Pola has traveled so much that it bores her to
think of it. When she talked she lifted a curtain
and let me peep into a wonderful world. I think
she liked me. She’s going to put me in a theme only
she is going to make me like Isolde who just to be
mean made me receive the Leaguers this morning
and went upstairs and did things as though it was not
Saturday at all. But for that I must love her just as
if she had not done it to be mean for I would not
have met Pola. Pola—is that not the most romantic
name you ever heard?—feels sorry for me because
my father was a poet and she knew right off how I
hate having the Leaguers own us and the house.
She was wonderful. I shall never see anyone like
her again. My life is doomed to be sad and lonely.</p>

<p class='c011' >“But though I never see Pola again I shall try
to live to be like her. Inside of me, of course. It
would be no use to try to be like her outside on account
of my horrid hair. Pola’s hair is curly and short
and she wears it caught with a ‘bonny bright ribbon.’
My eyes are plain blue and hers are a mysterious
gray like an evening sky. Her skin is like creamy
satin touched with rose petals and I think it is natural
for it is not a bit like Josie Walker’s who uses
rouge for Nancy caught her putting it on one day
at school in the toilet. Pola is as brave as she is
beautiful. She dares anything. She would despise
me if she knew that I just let my fate close over my
head and do nothing.</p>

<p class='c011' >“But now that I am fifteen before the world I
must take my life in my hands. As adventure will
never come to this house on account of the League I
must go forth to meet adventure. I will not let the
others know what I am planning for, as I said heretofore,
Isolde does not understand me and Victoria
would only laugh. And as I said heretofore, I hate
her when she laughs. But, Victoria Romley, remember
the words of the prophet: ‘He who laughs last
laughs loudest.’</p>

<p class='c011' >“In case I pass to the Great Beyond and strange
eyes read these confidences, let me add that I only
hate Vicky when she laughs. At all other times I
love her dearly. She is so beautiful that sometimes
when I look at her I feel all queer and gaspy inside.
Pola is not quite as beautiful as Vic but Pola is a
girl like me.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Dear Dorothea, friend of my inner spirit, as I
close this page who knows what the future holds
for me? I shall probably be very busy with my
plans and may neglect you, my comforter, but as I
go forth on my quest I shall often think of you,
waiting, faithful, in my secret cranny. And I shall
think of Isolde and Trude for I gleaned from
something Isolde said to me this morning when she was
mad that she and Trude long to escape from the
League the way I do. But they think they have to
stay here the rest of their lives. Mayhap I can bring
escape to them. Vick will marry of course, but
Isolde’s beaux look too poor to get married and they
are mostly poets as I have told you. And Trude
has only her one Lost Love. Dear
Dorothea, farewell. ‘Mid pleasures and palaces
though I may roam, my heart will come to thee in
thy deep and secret chamber.’”</p>

<p class='c012' >Sidney liked the last line so well that she paused
to read it over, aloud.</p>

<p class='c008' >She closed the book simply because her thoughts
were racing ahead so fast that to write them became
a torture. She restored “Dorothea” rather carelessly
to her “deep and secret chamber.” Having secured
the loose planking she rose and turned her agile mind
to the consideration of a desire that had began shaping
when Trude said she could go around the world
with the Egg. Of course the Egg would not take
her that far but if it would only just take her somewhere
on a train she’d be satisfied.</p>

<p class='c008' >Travel in the Romley family had always been
limited. One shabby bag had done comfortable
duty for them all. Joseph Romley had never wanted
to go away; if the girls’ mother ever yearned for
other horizons she had hidden it behind a smiling
contentment. Neither Isolde nor Trude had gone
further than fifty miles from Middletown until the
two trustees, after their father’s death, had summoned
them to New York. Victoria, seemingly born
to more fortune than the others, had been whisked
away on several trips with Godmother Jocelyn, traveling
luxuriously in a stateroom with a maid but she
had returned from even the most prolonged of these
so silent and dispirited that Sidney suspected traveling
with Godmother Jocelyn, fat and fussy, was
not the unalloyed pleasure Vick would have them
believe.</p>

<p class='c008' >To how much Sidney longed to vision the world
that lay beyond the level horizons of Middletown
an old map of the United States and Canada, tacked
to one of the rafters, attested. Upon this Sidney
had marked with various signs that meant much to
her and nothing to any one else, the different localities
of which she read in books or newspapers. When
a Leaguer introduced some devotee from some far-off
city Sidney promptly noted the visit on the map.
In consequence she had a vicarious acquaintance scattered
from coast to coast. It was the only way she
had ever expected to “know” the world until Trude
had said that about the Egg.</p>

<p class='c008' >She did not count as “traveling” going once to
Cascade Lake, twenty miles to the South, and spending
a week there with Nancy. They had not gone
on a train; they had driven down with Nancy’s father
in the automobile. Though in anticipation the visit
had appeared like an adventure, in later retrospection
it was stupid. It had been just like being at
Nancy’s house in Middletown; Nancy’s father and
mother and Snap, the dog, and Caroline, the colored
cook, and much of the furniture were all there. It
had rained all week and they had had to play in the
house and Nancy had had a cold in her head which
had made her cross and horrid-looking. No, that
had not been “going” somewhere, the way Trude
went to New York and Isolde to Chicago.</p>

<p class='c008' >Crouched low in the sound rocker Sidney stared
at the old map with speculative eyes. One could
not, when one was the youngest sister, simply pack
the old bag and start off for just anywhere. All the
trips she knew anything about had some objective;
one went somewhere to see somebody. Trude went
to see Aunt Edith White, Isolde the Deerings. Vick
always went somewhere with Godmother Jocelyn.
Plainly her first step was to find someone who lived
somewhere where she could want to go.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was a pity, Sidney lamented voicelessly, that
her father had shunned all their relatives the way
he had the autograph seekers. Nancy had a great
many; she was always going to reunions at some
aunt’s or cousin’s or her mother was having a big
“family” dinner. It would help her now to have a
few cousins herself. They surely must have some
somewhere. Everyone did. That her father had
snubbed them would not make them any the
less related.</p>

<p class='c008' >She suddenly remembered a book she had found
once in a box consigned to the attic in that first
settling. The book for a while had fascinated her
and Nancy, then they had thrown it aside for something
more novel, little dreaming that it was destined
to hold an important part in the shaping of Sidney’s
fortunes—and misfortunes. It was a very slender
little volume with an embellished binding, long since
yellow with dust.</p>

<p class='c008' >Finding it now Sidney drew the sleeve of her
blouse across its cover and opened it. Its first
page was given over to a curious tree from the
sprawling branches of which hung round things
much like grapefruits, each ring encircling one or
two names. From each fruit dangled more fruit
until the tree was quite overladen. A line at the bottom
explained that the curious growth was the Tree
of the New England Ellis Family.</p>

<p class='c008' >At that first inspection Sidney had felt no particular
sense of belonging herself to the suspended
grapefruits; the only thought that had held her was
how many, many years it had taken all those people
to live and what a little minute to read their names.
But finding an “Ann Ellis” in a corner of the tree
had brought them suddenly close to her. “Ann
Ellis Green”—why, that was her mother’s name.
She and Nancy figured out at once that these were
her mother’s ancestors—<i>her</i> ancestors. Nancy had
supplied the word. Nancy had been deeply impressed
by the Tree and the Coat-of-Arms which had come
down to these Ellises from a Welsh baron of feudal
times. She had urged Sidney to use it on her school
papers.</p>

<p class='c008' >But neither the Coat-of-Arms nor the Tree held
any especial value to Sidney, brought up as she had
been in a state of family isolation, until this moment.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now the little book offered the reasonable possibility
that each ancestor recorded therein had had
children, just as that Ann Ellis in the round enclosure
had had her mother and her mother in turn had
had Isolde and Trude and Vick and herself. These
children would be cousins—and cousins were what
she needed!</p>

<p class='c008' >She remembered certain notations that had been
made in a fine script on back pages of the book. In
search of cousins she now scanned these carefully,
with a shivery feeling of prowling over dead bones—the
writing was so queer and faded, the paper
crackled and smelled so old.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Charles Ellis, son of James by Mary Martin,
second wife. Served in the 102nd Regiment at
Gettysburg. Awarded the Congressional Medal for
exceptional bravery under fire.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Priscilla Ellis gave her life in the service of
nursing through the epidemic of small-pox that swept
Boston in the year of 18—” Sidney read this twice
with a thrill. That was adventure for you. Small-pox.
She wondered if Priscilla had been beautiful
like Victoria and whether she had left a sweetheart
to mourn her tragic death to the end of his days.
She liked to think Priscilla had had such.</p>

<p class='c008' >That one Abner Ellis had been a Selectman for
ten years did not interest her—she passed him for the
next entry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Ann Ellis married Jonathan Green, June 10,
1874. To this happy union has been born one precious
daughter, our little Ann.” Why, this “little
Ann” was her own mother, of course. And the
Jonathan Green who was her father had written in
the book the little notes about all the Ellises so that
when the “Little Ann” grew up she would know all
about them and be proud—Priscilla who had died
of small-pox and the ancestor with the Congressional
Medal. Sidney suddenly thought it strange that her
mother had cared so little for the family tree that she
had left it, dusty and forgotten, in the attic. Probably
that was because her mother had been too busy
being a poet’s wife to bother about dead and gone
Ellises.</p>

<p class='c008' >She felt a little rush of tender remorse toward
Jonathan Green—she wished he had not died when
her mother was a little girl. He was her own
grandfather. And <i>he</i> had had a tree behind <i>him</i>—there
had doubtless been as many Greens as Ellises.
She wished she knew what <i>they</i> had been like. And
almost in answer to the thought her eyes fell upon an
entry on another page, made in Jonathan Green’s
fine hand.</p>

<p class='c008' >“On this day, October 6, 1869, my brother,
Ezekiel Green, sailed from Provincetown for far
shores on his good ship the <i>Betsy King</i> which same
has come into his possession as a reward for
years of thrift and perseverance. God’s blessing go
with him—”</p>

<p class='c008' >There were more entries concerning the brother,
Ezekiel. He and his good ship the <i>Betsy King</i> were
reported as returning safely from the Azores, and
again they had rounded Cape Horn, again had ventured
to East Indian waters.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh-h!” cried Sidney aloud for at the top of
another page she read that the <i>Betsy King</i> had
foundered off the Cape in the storm of ’72—with all
lives. “May the soul of my beloved brother, Ezekiel
Green, rest in peace with his Maker.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney forgot the Burton-Ellis tree in her breathless
interest in the fate of Ezekiel Green who had
“foundered” and then rested in peace. It was like
a story of marvellous adventure. Her grandfather
had evidently thought a great deal of this brother
who had sailed the oceans wide. He had added,
beneath the entry of the foundering of the <i>Betsy
King</i>: “Our loving prayers go out in behalf of
our beloved Ezekiel’s son and daughter, Asabel and
Achsa. May they walk in the path their respected
father trod before them!” “That’s funny,” reflected
Sidney, “How <i>can</i> they when he sailed the
wide seas!”</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<a href='images/illus-056f.jpg'><img src='images/illus-056.jpg' alt='' class='ig004' /></a>
<p>HER EYES FELL UPON AN ENTRY ON ANOTHER PAGE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >Sidney’s brain actually crackled with lightning
calculations. This Asabel and Achsa must be old but
they might be still living—and at Provincetown,
from whence the <i>Betsy King</i> had sailed. Perhaps
Asabel had a boat, too. Provincetown—she looked
at the map. Why, Provincetown was at the very tip
end of that crooked finger of land which always
seemed to be beckoning to ships to come to Massachusetts.
She knew all about it—she and Nancy had
read a delightful book in which a little girl had lived
with two guardians who were old sea captains—like
Ezekiel Green. And she, Sidney Romley, had
never known that she had relatives, real flesh-and-blood
relatives, lots of them, no doubt, who lived
right on Cape Cod! She wished that Nancy were
with her that she might tell her at once. She figured
off the generations on her fingers. Ezekiel Green was
her mother’s uncle, her great uncle. This son and
daughter, Asabel and Achsa, were her mother’s first
cousins, <i>her</i> second cousins. She felt suddenly
proudly rich in kin.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Cousin Achsa!” she repeated the name slowly,
wondering just how she ought to pronounce it. She
pictured Cousin Achsa living in a square white
cupolaed house of noble dimensions that crowned
a rocky eminence from which a sweeping view of
ocean distances might be had.</p>

<p class='c008' >This picture had no more than shaped itself in
her mind than the resolution formed to communicate
at once with Asabel and Achsa. Not a day must
be lost. When one had girded oneself to set forth
in quest of the Gleam one must not dally over any
uncertainties.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney climbed on to the box before the high
desk and spread the book before her for reference
in spelling her relatives’ names. Then she took out
a sheet of writing paper and dipped an old pen into
a bottle of ink.</p>

<p class='c008' >Her imagination seething, it was not difficult
to frame her unusual letter. Indeed, the writing of
it fell into quite easy lines.</p>

<p class='c013' >“Dear Cousin Achsa:</p>

<p class='c011' >“You will be very much surprised to get a letter
from your second cousin, Sidney Ellis Romley. But
I have heard my mother speak of you often. (Let
it be said in justice to Sidney that she hesitated over
this outrageous fib, then decided it was justified by
the necessity for tact. However, some quick calculation
caused her to amend her statement.) At least my
older sisters have told me that she spoke often of
you. You see she died when I was a baby. My
father is dead, too. I live with my sisters in Middletown.
I am the youngest though I am fifteen.</p>

<p class='c011' >“My sisters have travelled extensively but I have
never gone anywhere. But this summer I am going
to have the Egg which is a sum of money that comes
to us each year. (Here Sidney had paused to consider
whether she ought to confess that her father
had been a poet. She decided she need not.) I can
spend the Egg any way I want to. I think I will
go somewhere on a train. I came across a family
tree of the New England Ellises which told all about
the Greens, too, and Ezekiel Green who is your
father as you know and his good ship the <i>Betsy King</i>
which I think was thrilling and how his soul is with
his Maker and all about you and Cousin Asabel and
it was so interesting, I mean the Greens, not the
Ellises, that I have decided to visit you if it is convenient.
I will not be any trouble. I wish you would
write and tell me if I can come. I shall await your
letter with trembling expectancy.</p>

<p class='c011' >“Your most affectionate and new-found Cousin,</p>

<div class='c014'>“Sidney Ellis Romley.”</div>

<p class='c012' >Sidney hurried the letter into an envelope, sealed
it and addressed it. For a dreadful moment she
wondered if she ought to know a street number in
Provincetown. This Achsa might have married and
have another name. Then she remembered that
Isolde always put their own address in one corner
of her envelopes. She printed it on hers in square
letters. “There, it’ll come back to me if it doesn’t
find Cousin Achsa! But, oh, I hope it does.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Sid-ney!</i> Luncheon. I’ve called you three
times.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Vick’s voice, sharply rebuking, broke across
Sidney’s occupation. She jumped hurriedly from
her perch, tucking the letter into the pocket of her
blouse. Her lips pressed together in a straight thin
line of red. Life must, of course, appear to go on
as usual—school and the same stupid things she did
every day, Nancy, who was so distressingly short of
the standard Pola had that day forever fixed. No
one, her sisters least, must suspect that Adventure
loomed so close. She would guard her plans carefully
in her “inscrutable breast.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c006'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />“THE SUMMER WILL TELL WHO LAUGHS LAST!”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >To use Sidney’s own thought, “things happened”
with amazing swiftness. If a fairy godmother had
been invited in at her christening her plans could not
have prospered more.</p>

<p class='c008' >First came Mrs. Milliken’s unpleasant announcement
that the Summer Convention of the League
was to be held in Middletown during July which
meant that every day for two weeks would see the
old house invaded by the curious and the reverent.
Mrs. Milliken, in Sidney’s hearing, had gently hinted
that it would be very nice if the girls could go away
somewhere for July—at least all of them except
dear Isolde.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then Sidney heard for the first time of Isolde’s
invitation to the Deerings. Isolde had thrown it in
self-defense at Mrs. Milliken. “I do not expect to
be here, Mrs. Milliken. I am going to Professor
Deering’s for July and August to help him with his
new book.” Sidney turned away to hide a sudden
smile, not, however, before she caught Trude’s eyes
anxiously upon her.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then the Egg—seventy whole dollars—came on
the same day that Godmother Jocelyn informed Vick
by telegram that if she could be ready by the first
of July she could go with her to California by way
of the Canadian Rockies. “Be ready! Well, I should
just say I <i>could</i>!” Vick’s eyes had shone like stars
against a velvet black sky and Sidney had again
intercepted that anxious glance from Trude.</p>

<p class='c008' >Isolde considered this an auspicious moment,
with all the excitement over Vick, to break to Sidney
their plans for the summer—plans hurried to a head
by the League’s announcement.</p>

<p class='c008' >“And Trude’s going to Long Island with the
Whites, dear, but you won’t be lonely with Huldah.
You can have Nancy here and probably she will
invite you down to Cascade.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, there’s a letter from Huldah on the table
in the hall! I meant to bring it in and forgot,”
cried Vick.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Get it, dear,” asked Isolde, gently, of Sidney.
Action would help Sidney control her disappointment—if
the child <i>was</i> disappointed. Perhaps Trude
was over-apprehensive.</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude hastily scanned the few lines of the letter
Sidney put into her hands. “Oh, <i>dear</i>,” she exclaimed
“Huldah can’t come.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Could any fairy godmother, indeed, have shaped
circumstances with more kindly hand?</p>

<p class='c008' >“She says she can’t leave her niece. Her niece’s
just had a baby. And her rheumatism is bad.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I call that rank disloyalty,” cried Isolde with
spirit. “After all we’ve stood from Huldah!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’ll we do? Can’t we make her come?
Doesn’t she owe us more consideration than her
niece?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude put the letter down. “Huldah isn’t disloyal.
You know that, Isolde. And she doesn’t owe
us anything. Don’t forget, Vick, that she worked
for us for years for almost nothing when she could
have gone anywhere else and received good pay.
This house <i>is</i> damp and big and Huldah is old. No,
we can’t beg her to come—over this. It was probably
hard for her to refuse. I’ll stay home with Sid.
We’ll have lots more fun here together than I’d have
with Aunt Edith White on Long Island—in spite
of the League. Will we not, Sid?”</p>

<p class='c008' >There was so much more sincerity in Trude’s
honest blue eyes than any suggestion of self-sacrifice
that Sidney ran around to her and hugged her. She
longed to tell Trude and the others of her own
budding plans—only she had not received as yet an
answer from Cousin Achsa. So all she could say
was: “We just won’t mind the League!”</p>

<p class='c008' >And then that very afternoon the postman, meeting
her outside the wall, had handed her an envelope
addressed to “Miss Sidney Ellis Romley” and postmarked
<i>Provincetown</i>!</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney ran with it straight to her attic retreat.
Her heart within her breast hurt with its high hopes.
There was a Cousin Achsa—her own letter had
reached her and had been answered! She studied
the unfamiliar writing on the envelope—it was a
big sweeping script. The envelope felt fine and soft
in her fingers and smelled faintly of a fragrance
that was not of flowers and yet distinctly pleasant.
Oh, this Cousin Achsa must be wealthy, like Pola!</p>

<p class='c008' >She broke the envelope and spread out the double
sheet it contained. At its top she read, “My dear
little Cousin.” She paused long enough to wonder
why Cousin Achsa thought that she was little.</p>

<p class='c013' >“My dear little Cousin:</p>

<p class='c011' >“Of course you may come to visit us. We shall
enjoy learning to love a young cousin who must be
delightful if we can judge from her letter. We
blame ourselves and the miles that have separated
us for not knowing anything of ‘Sidney Ellis Romley’
until yesterday, though we knew your mother in
days long past. Will you write and tell us when we
may expect you? Can a girl of fifteen find her way
to this outlying bit of country? If you decide you
cannot perhaps we can arrange for you to come with
someone. We await your word with affectionate
anticipation.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'   >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your already loving cousin,</div>
      <div class='line'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Achsa.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012' >Sidney blinked hard simply to be certain that the
words actually lay before her eyes. Then she read
it again and again—aloud. Oh, it was too wonderful
to believe. It was a <i>beautiful</i> letter—Cousin Achsa
must surely live in the square white house on the
eminence she had pictured. She had written “we”
so perhaps Cousin Asabel still lived or maybe there
were young cousins. Anyway, they wanted her. She
hugged the letter to her and rushed off to find the
girls. Oh, Huldah could stay with her niece if she
wanted to! And Trude could go to Long Island!
The Leaguers could come and camp in the house!
Guided by the murmur of voices Sidney broke headlong
into an informal conference of the older sisters.
Her drama-loving soul could not have built a more
perfect stage, nor asked a more thrilling moment of
denouement. Isolde had just declared generously,
that she could not enjoy a day of her stay with the
Deerings if Trude had to give up the Long Island
plans.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It isn’t as though we girls received invitations
every day,” she explained tearfully. “And it’ll be
stupid for you here, Trude, with just Sidney. Perhaps
it’s my duty to stay home and help Mrs.
Milliken.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Your sacrifice is quite unnecessary!” Sid
answered in such a queer voice that the three older
girls stared at her in alarm. In truth her flushed face
and wild eyes gave strength to the sudden conviction
that she had gone mad! She fairly leaped at Isolde
and flung her letter into Isolde’s lap. “I guess ‘just
Sid’ is capable of making her own plans!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney had a moment’s terror that she was
“beginning” wrong but Isolde’s remark which she
had overheard had upset all her preplanned diplomacy.
Now she stood back, anxiously, and watched
Isolde read the letter.</p>

<p class='c008' >As Isolde read it aloud she punctuated it with
excited exclamations.</p>

<p class='c008' >“‘My dear little Cousin’—Why, Sid, how did
you happen to write to her? How did you know
she wasn’t dead? Why—‘Of course you may come
and visit us!’ Sid, what <i>have</i> you been doing?
Why—” and so, to the end.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney drew a long breath and braced herself.
Her explanation tumbled out with such incoherence
that the girls kept interrupting her to ask her to
repeat something. Well, they had told her she could
use the Egg any way she wanted to and she wanted
to go somewhere a long way off—on a train. One
always had to visit someone or with somebody and
she’d remembered these cousins—</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, how <i>could</i> you, Sid? I don’t think you’ve
ever heard us speak of them. I’m sure I’d almost
forgotten them—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, I <i>did</i>. Blood’s thicker than water,”
witheringly, “and maybe you can just remember
relatives without ever hearing anything about them.
She’s nice, I know, because her father was persevering
and thrifty—”</p>

<p class='c008' >A sudden laugh from Vick brought Sidney to
an abrupt stop. But Isolde, rebuking Vick with a
lift of her right shoulder, turned her attention again
to the letter.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s a very nice letter—a—a cultured letter,
don’t you think so, Trude? Somehow I have always
had the idea that these relations in the East—the
Greens—were very poor and—well, uneducated. But
this letter doesn’t look like it. And they actually
seem to <i>want</i> Sidney to come!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s a long way—” Trude put in.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But I want to <i>go</i> a long way. I don’t just want
to go to some place right near home—like Cascade.
There’s money enough—Nancy and I asked at the
railroad station. And the man there gave me a timetable
with all sorts of interesting pictures on it. It’s
the very most interesting place I ever heard of—it’s
an education. I want to go. I’ve—I’ve never been
anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Isolde was trying not to look as though this
unexpected development of things was pleasing but
she simply could not suppress the thought that in
permitting Sid to go to these cousins lay their one
chance of happy escape for their summer. After all—these
Cape Cod relatives <i>were</i> first cousins of their
mother’s, her very own people. She wished she could
remember what her mother had told of them from
time to time but it could not have been anything to
their discredit or she would have remembered. And
the letter, in its woody fragrance, the bold sweep of
the handwriting, the expensive texture of the paper,
bespoke culture, even wealth. However, with a lingering
sense of duty, she reminded Sidney that this
Cousin Achsa must be very old.</p>

<p class='c008' >As if that mattered! Sidney flung out an impatient
hand. It was like Isolde to sit rock-fashion
and trump up reasons why she’d better not go. But
Vick came unexpectedly to her aid.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If she’s old—all the better. She’ll make Sid
behave herself. I think this is the luckiest thing that
could have happened. Now we can all go away. Sid
wanted adventure—she’ll have it with Cousin—what’s
her name?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Though she writhed under the tone in Vick’s
voice Sidney bit her lips over the retort that sprang
to them. Anyway, she <i>would</i> have her adventure.
She wanted to go on the train all alone; the ticket office
man had said it would be quite safe and had
told her that he’d write something on a card that
she could show to each conductor. She’d like not
to have even to do <i>that</i>, for that seemed a little
babyish.</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude had found a reassuring thought. “I’ll be
near enough, anyway, so that if Sid gets homesick
or finds that things aren’t just what she’d like them
to be she can telegraph to me and come home. You
will, won’t you, kid?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sid promised hastily. Then for the next half
hour everything whirled about her; she could not
believe what her ears heard, what her eyes beheld.
The girls were actually planning for her—clothes,
trunks, tickets, trains. Trude was figuring and making
notes on the back of Cousin Achsa’s letter. It
was, “Sid will need this—Sid had better do that—it
will be nice for Sid to see this—I think by way of
Boston is the better route—you’d better write to
Cousin Achsa, Trude—No, let Sid write herself—had
we ought to consult the Trustees? Why, we’re
old enough to decide this for ourselves—she’d better
go just before Vick and then we can pack away
our intimate things and turn the house over to
the League.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Didn’t Evangeline come from somewhere up
that way? Oh, no. Well, I always think of Cape
Cod and Nova Scotia as being off there on the map
together. Anyway, write and tell us, kid, when you
find the Chalice or Grail or whatever it is! If you
discover any untrodden fields of romance—wire us
and we’ll send one of Issy’s poets down—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, in her exalted spirit Sid could meet Vick’s
raillery with a level glance. Let Vick laugh! Cape
Cod wasn’t off “somewhere” in a corner of the
map. It was as intriguing as the Canadian Rockies.
And she had a lot shut away in her heart about
which Vick and the others knew nothing. All that
about the good ship <i>Betsy King</i>. <i>Betsy King</i> had
foundered as a good ship should, but there was a
big chance that Cousin Asabel, Ezekiel’s son, might
have a boat. Then she had a glimpse into a beautiful
world that Pola had given her; she would see Pola’s
world from the train window. It was simply all too
breath-taking to think of. Oh, the summer would
tell who would laugh last!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c006'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />SUNSET LANE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >When Tillie Higgins saw Joe the baker’s cart
pass her house she ran to her gate.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He must be going to Eph Calkins or to Achsy
Green’s. Now I wonder—” Joe rarely penetrated
Sunset Lane with his goods; Tillie Higgins and old
Mrs. Calkins did their own baking and Achsa
Green’s pies were legend.</p>

<p class='c008' >Old Mrs. Calkins, too, had seen the baker’s
rickety cart approaching through the deep sand. At
once she “happened” to be out tying up her yellow
rambler.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Got a letter for Achsy Green,” the baker called
to her, leaning out of his cart.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You don’t say! Not bad news, I hope?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Dunno. It’s a letter. Thought I’d bring it to
her. Gettap, General. Pretty nice weather we’re
havin’. Dry, though.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Tell Achsy I’ll drop over soon’s my bakin’s
done.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Tillie Higgins’ shadow fell across the yellow
roses. Tillie was a little breathless; she had hurried
over to catch what the baker was saying.</p>

<p class='c008' >“A letter? For Achsy Green? You don’t say.
Not bad news I hope,” she echoed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Joe dunno. Cal’late that’s why he came all this
way with it. He’ll find out what’s in that letter if he
can. Then the hul town’ll know. I told him to tell
Achsy I’d drop over soon’s my pies are out of the
oven. Better set down a spell and go along
with me.”</p>

<p class='c008' >But Tillie Higgins, with regret in her voice,
explained that she had bread in her own oven. “If
it’s news send Martie over with it. Hope it’s nothing
bothersome. Achsy Green has ’nough as ’tis.”</p>

<p class='c008' >This Sunset Lane was the farthest byway of the
northernmost habitation of Cape Cod. Only a ridge
of sandy dunes at its back door kept it from tumbling
into the blue Atlantic. Provincetown folk called it
“up p’int way” and “t’other end.” The more fanciful
name had been given to it by a young Portuguese
who had essayed to convert that corner of
Provincetown into a summer colony. He had only
succeeded, after long effort, in selling the Carpenter
house nearest Commercial Street, then had abandoned
his enterprise to open a combination garage
and one-arm lunch room on Commercial Street.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sunset Lane led nowhere, unless one counted the
dunes; it was only wide enough for a cart to pass
between the hedging rows of crowding wild flowers
and the guardian willows; it was deep in sand. The
rising tide of commercialism that was destroying the
eighteenth-century dignity of the little town turned
before it reached it. Few went there unless on
definite purpose bound, excepting the artists who
came singly and in groups to paint an old gray gable
against an overtowering hill of sand or a scrap of
blue sky between crumbling chimney pots and peaked
roofs or old Mrs. Calkins’ hollyhocks that flanked the
narrow byway like gaudy soldiers. Some sketched
Jeremiah Higgins’ octagonal house, more of an oddity
than a thing of grace yet ornamented with hand-wrought
cornices and dignified by a figurehead from
the prow of a ship long since split into driftwood;
others went on to the end of the lane to catch upon
their canvases the grace of Achsa’s Green’s old gray-shingled
cottage with its low roof and white pilastered doorway.</p>

<p class='c008' >With the changing years Achsa Green had become
as quaint as her surroundings. Bent, and small, her
face seared to the brown of a withered leaf from the
hot suns and biting winds, her hands knotted with
labor, her sparse hair twisted into a knob at the exact
center of the back of her head, she was not lovely
to look upon, yet from her eyes gleamed a spirit that
knew no wear of age, that took its knocks upstanding,
that suffered when others suffered but that
spread a healing philosophy of God’s wisdom. For
Achsa’s acceptance of God’s wisdom faltered only
when she thought of Lavender.</p>

<p class='c008' >Lavender was her brother Asabel’s only child.
His mother had died a week after his birth, his
father five months before. Achsa had taken the
babe into her arms and had promised to “do” for
him. And she had, with a fierce yearning, a compassion
that hurt to her very soul. For Lavender
was not like other children; his poor little body was
sadly crippled. Achsa had at first refused to believe
but that he might “grow straight,” then as the years
convinced her that this could never be she consecrated
herself to the single task of keeping him fed
and clothed and happy and “out o’ mischief.” She
clung staunchly to the hope that, if she prayed hard
enough by night and believed by day that her boy
was “straight,” sometime Lavender <i>would</i> be
straight and all their little world—the Cape—would
know.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was nothing unusual in Dugald Allan of
Rahway, N. J., finding Sunset Lane, for he was a
fledgling artist and came there like other artists, but
certainly a destiny that was kind toward old Achsa
had something to do in the skirmish that ensued
between Poker, Allan’s brindle bull-pup, and Nip and
Tuck, Achsa Green’s two black cats. Tuck, caught
sunning herself in the middle of the lane, had recognized
a foe in Poker and had defended her stronghold;
Poker, resenting her exclusiveness, had offered
battle. Nip, never far from his sister, had promptly
thrown himself into the fray. There had resulted a
whirl of sand like a miniature cyclone from which
young Allan rescued Poker just in time to save his
brindle hide. Nip, unvanquished, had retreated to
the very doorway that Allan had come to paint;
Tuck fled to the shelter of a bed of tall sweet
william.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Dear! Dear!” cried Achsa Green in the open
doorway. “Oh, my cats—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Nobody hurt. I’m sorry,” laughed young
Allan. “I mean—Poker’s sorry. I don’t understand
his rudeness. He never fights anyone smaller
than himself. I’ve brought him up to a high sporting
code. He must have misunderstood your cat’s
attitude. He apologizes, humbly.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Assured that her pets were unharmed the little old
woman in the doorway had laughed gleefully.
“Tuck’s sort o’ suspicious o’ strange folks, but I cal’late
she didn’t take a good look at <i>you</i>! She must a
looked at your dog first!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I thank you for the compliment. You see, we
came quite peaceably to paint your doorway. You’re
Miss Green, aren’t you? I’m sure that’s the door
they told me about. And if your defiant animal will
stand like that long enough for me to sketch it—I’d
consider myself in luck—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I cal’late he will—if your dog’s ’round. Nip
ain’t ’fraid of nothin’ ’slong as his own door’s at his
back. Don’t know as anyone’s wanted to draw his
picture before. He’ll be all set up for sure!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Whipping out his pad Dugald Allan, with rapid
strokes, had sketched the door and the cat—and
Achsa Green. Later the picture he painted from the
sketch hung in a Paris exhibition. When he showed
the drawing to Achsa Green she had beamed with
pleasure. “Why, that’s as like Nip as though it war
a twin.” Nip, scenting the friendly atmosphere, had
relaxed, stretched, yawned, waved a plumy tail
toward poor Poker, watching fearfully from behind
his master, and had stalked, disdainful, over to the
sweet william to reassure the more timid Tuck.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of course Achsa Green had wanted to show the
“picture” to Lavender and Dugald Allan, eager to
see the inside of the old house, had followed her into
the low-ceilinged kitchen. And that had been ten years
ago and each succeeding spring since had brought
Dugald Allan back to Sunset Lane.</p>

<p class='c008' >Achsa Green knew him only as “a nice appearin’
boy—not so much on looks,” with a kindly manner
toward Lavender and an appreciation of the merits
of Nip and Tuck. And inasmuch as Nip and Tuck
made friendly advances to Poker and Lavender
would do things for Dugald Allan that he would not
do for anyone else, she finally consented to “let”
her gable room to the young stranger and to board
him as well. In settling the matter of board young
Allan had had to deal with a pride as hard as the
granite of the breakwall he could glimpse from the
one window of his room; it had been only after he
convinced Aunt Achsa that he could never feel like
“one of the folks” until he contributed something to
the upkeep of the family, that he had persuaded her
to accept the sum of money which he considered
barely repaid her trouble but which Aunt Achsa
deemed a fortune.</p>

<p class='c008' >Wisely young Allan paid the “board money” at
the bank. He had come to know Aunt Achsa’s failings,
how sometimes she stowed her scant earnings
away and forgot its hiding place; how at other times
she gave them to someone needier than herself.
Many a one of her generation had told him that she
was without “sense” where business was concerned.
It was everyone’s wonder how she’d managed to feed
two mouths, not counting the cats, with Lavender
not earning so much as his salt. And gradually, as
the summers passed, Allan took upon his shoulders
other responsibilities; planning safe pastimes for
Lavender; marketing, after which the kitchen cupboards
groaned with food; persuading Aunt Achsa
to let her rugs go and putter in her flowers while
the summer lasted.</p>

<p class='c008' >With the Cape standards of wealth it would not
have made any difference to Achsa Green, anyway,
or to anyone else, if they had known that the “nice-appearin’
boy” in the old flannels was the only son
of Roderick Allan, President of the Allan Iron
Works of Newark, New Jersey. Not half so much
difference as the old flannels made to Dugald’s
mother. The inclination on the part of their boy to
be “queer,” for under that head they put all his predilections
that differed from their ambitions—distressed
his parents very much. The boy had “everything”
and he didn’t care a rap about “anything”;
they looked upon his spells of dreamy preoccupation
as “loafing.” His father had an executive office in
the iron works waiting for him when he finished college,
a job at which any red-blooded young fellow
would jump, and Dugald talked of painting. His
mother had grieved that he would take no part in the
social whirl that made up her existence, that he
laughed at the creed of her “set,” scouted the class
commandments by which she lived. When he
expressed the intention of going on a tramp over
Cape Cod she had encouraged the whim. She had
believed that the discomforts of such an expedition
would cure him of his “notions.” She had motored
to Provincetown two summers before and she
thought it a forlorn place; the hotels were impossible,
the streets dusty and crowded, everything smelled
fishy and one was always elbowing great foreign
creatures in dirty oilskins and rubber boots.</p>

<p class='c008' >Like many a mother she had been too busy living
down to her rapidly accruing wealth to know the
man her boy had grown to be. All her upbringing
notwithstanding he was a simple soul with a sympathetic
understanding of his fellow mortals; a quiet
humor and a keen perception of beauty that abhorred
the false or superficial, a brain that stifled in crowded
places. He much preferred knocking elbows with
men of homely labor to the crowded and law-breaking
parties he came to Cape Cod to escape; he found
among the fisherfolk, the old gray wharves, the sandy
dunes, everlastingly swept with the clean breath of
the Atlantic, a peace of mind and an inspiration he
had never known elsewhere. The longing in his
heart to paint that had been scarcely more than an
urge, took definite and splendid shape. Someone else
had the executive job in his father’s manufacturing
plant.</p>

<p class='c008' >That he grew to know that Aunt Achsa needed
him and looked forward to his coming strengthened
the bond that brought him back to Sunset Lane each
spring. No one had ever needed him before and it
was a man-satisfying sensation. And in Aunt Achsa’s
affection for him there was a depth which he divined
but only vaguely understood. In his hardy six feet
four the compassionate mother-woman was seeing
her poor Lavender, big and strong and “straight.”
To her Dugald was what Lavender “wasn’t”; in her
way she put him and Lavender together and made a
satisfying whole. Sometimes she wondered if Dugald
might not be the answer to her prayers!</p>

<p class='c008' >It had been to young Allan that Aunt Achsa had
carried the letter that the baker brought so unexpectedly
to the door. Joe had lingered on the doorstep,
but had not been rewarded by any hint of its contents.
Achsa could not remember when she had had
a letter before. She fingered the envelope apprehensively.
Yet it could scarcely be bad news of any sort,
for there was just herself and Lavender and he was
only down in the flats. No one would write anything
about <i>him</i>.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Read it—my eyes ain’t certain with folk’s writing,”
she had begged Dugald Allan, in a shaky voice.
Thereupon he had read aloud Sidney’s letter.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I never!” “I swan!” “Why, that’s Annie
Green’s girl—Annie was Jon’than’s daughter—I
rec’lect her when she wasn’t much bigger than a pint
of cider.” Achsa Green fluttered with excitement
like a quivering brown leaf caught in a sudden stir
of wind. “And the little thing says she knows all
about me. Heard her folks tell. Well, well, I
wouldn’t ’a said there was a God’s soul knew about
Achsa Green outside this harbor! The little pretty.
And her ma’s dead—died when she was a baby, poor
little mite. Sidney—that’s not a Cape name. Like as
not they got it from the other side. Well, Uncle
Jon’than allas was diff’runt—he was for books and
learnin’ and was a peaked sort, as I rec’lect him—He
was consid’rable younger than Pa!”</p>

<p class='c008' >During Achsa’s excited soliloquy Dugald Allan
had an opportunity to reread the letter. He smiled
broadly over the reading. But his smile changed to
a quick frown as he observed the signature. For a
brief second he pondered over it, then by a shake of
his head seemed to dismiss some thought.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What are you going to tell her?” he asked
Achsa Green. “Will you let her come on?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Achsa Green started. She had not thought of the
real business of the letter. “Why, I don’t know.
It’s a poor place for a young girl—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t talk like that, Aunt Achsa. Haven’t I
told you this is the only corner of the earth where
God’s air is sweet—and untainted?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Achsa Green could only understand what her Mr.
Dugald meant by the expression of his eyes. Now,
they encouraged her. “I might fix up the downstairs
bedroom. It ain’t been used except to store
things since Lavender was born in there and his ma
was taken out in a box, but I don’t know but that I
could fix it up suit’ble; a young girl ain’t so finicky as
grownups. If you won’t mind havin’ a young piece
’round—” uncertainly.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was <i>not</i> exactly to Dugald Allan’s liking to
have a “young piece” around. He had planned some
difficult and steady work for the summer. And he
had an unreasonable aversion to fifteen-year-olds, at
least the kind like his young cousin and her friends,
which was the only kind he really knew. But he was
touched by Aunt Achsa’s delight in finding “flesh-and-blood”
kin; he did not like to dampen her pleasure.
He could work somewhere else, in one of the
corners of the breakwall or among the dunes. He
smilingly assured her that a “young piece” around
would add tremendously to his summer.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I dunno if I can write her a nice enough letter,
my hand shakes so, and I ain’t much of a head at
spelling. Pa never set anything by books himself and
Asabel’s and my schoolin’ sort o’ depended on the
elements.” Dugald Allan sensed that Achsa did not
want this little unknown cousin, miles away, to know
of her lack of “schoolin’.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Bless you, I’ll write and I’ll write just as though
it came from you.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t know as there’s a scrap of writin’ paper
in this house.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“My best is none too good,” promised young
Allan promptly, delighting in the growing pleasure
in the wrinkled face.</p>

<p class='c008' >But one more doubt assailed Achsa Green.
Lavender.</p>

<p class='c008' >“D’you think I ought to tell first hand—about
Lavender?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Early in his acquaintance with Aunt Achsa and
Sunset Lane Dugald had come to know how it hurt
Aunt Achsa to speak of Lavender as “being different.”
At first, with courteous consideration he had
avoided the truth—then as the summers passed he
himself had grown fond enough of the boy to forget
the crooked body.</p>

<p class='c008' >He hesitated a moment before he answered, then
he spoke gently:</p>

<p class='c008' >“No, Aunt Achsa. That is not necessary. And
anyway—it’s only the outer shell of him that is different,
his soul is fine and straight and manly.”</p>

<p class='c008' >At this Achsa’s eyes caressed him; he put so easily
into words what she tried so bravely to remember.</p>

<p class='c008' >And thus it had come about that Dugald Allan
wrote on his best stationery (which he kept for his
letters to his mother) to Sidney Ellis Romley, as
though, per promise, it was Cousin Achsa, herself.
He had had to write several letters before one quite
suited both him and Achsa. The letter despatched, to
his surprise he shared with Aunt Achsa considerable
interest in its outcome. It would certainly knock the
summer flat, but Aunt Achsa’s delighted anticipation
was rare.</p>

<p class='c008' >He helped her to prepare the “spare” room off
the parlor and to remove anything that might remind
its young occupant of that tragic passing of Lavender’s
mother “by box.” He abetted her safeguarding
the various mementoes of the days when the
<i>Betsy King</i> sailed into the harbor from foreign
shores.</p>

<p class='c008' >“No sense leavin’ things ’round waitin’ to be
knocked off long’s they lived through them cats. You
can’t tell what fifteen’s goin’ to be!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“No—” groaned Allan inwardly, “You certainly
can not.”</p>

<p class='c008' >In the last hours before Sidney’s expected arrival
he agreed to meet her. Though that was Lavender’s
duty he knew, as well as Achsa, that she could not
depend upon Lavender. “If he took it into his head
to go down to Rockman’s wharf why, he’d go—cousin
or no cousin comin’,” Aunt Achsa had worried;
and then Dugald had come to the rescue, even
promising to go so far as to hire Hiram Foss’s hack—none
of the town taxis would go through the sand
of Sunset Lane!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c006'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />WHEN DREAMS COME TRUE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“Land O’ Goshen, you don’t tell me you’re
cruisin’ down to the Cape all by yourself! Now, ain’t
that exciting! And you never been there before,
y’say?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney nodded, sitting very straight on the seat,
her hand closed tightly over her purse which contained
all that was left of the Egg after purchasing
her tickets. Her face perceptibly brightened. Others
had talked to her during the long journey but they
had had a way of saying “brave little girl” that
had been annoying and that had not helped the lump
that persisted in rising in her throat.</p>

<p class='c008' >This stranger Sidney felt was himself from the
Cape. He was big and broad and had bushy white
whiskers that encircled a very red face. From his
booming voice she knew he must have commanded
a ship; perhaps he knew Ezekiel Green and the <i>Betsy
King</i>. She smiled shyly at him as he slid into the
seat beside her. They were leaving Plymouth behind.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Goin’ to Provincetown? Well, now, that’s
about as far as you <i>can</i> go, ’lowin’ you ain’t goin’
to Race P’int Light, by chance. You be careful that
no pirates come ’long and ship and stow you in the
fo’castle! There’s a-plenty of ’em ’round these
waters yet.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Of course I know there aren’t really pirates—but
what’s a—a fo’castle?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Her new friend roared. “Bless the heart of the
little landlubber! Why, the—the fo’castle’s the—the
fo’castle—for’ard of the fo’mast. And don’t you be
too sure about the pirates—you ask Jed Starrow if
there ain’t! Only they don’t run up their flag no
more—I guess the black sky’s <i>their</i> flag.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Have they any treasure buried on the Cape?”
Sidney ventured.</p>

<p class='c008' >The old seaman started to laugh again, then
smothered it by a big hand at his whiskers. “Now
I won’t say they have or they haven’t. The Cape
ought to be full of it. And these here pirates I
speak of bury their treasures somewheres—jest
where’s the business of Uncle Sam’s men to find
out.” He struck his chest proudly and Sidney caught
the gleam of a badge pinned to one of the red
straps of his suspenders. He saw that she had
glimpsed it; doubtless he had intended she should.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Special deputy marshal—I’m Cap’n Phin
Davies of Wellfleet, retired, you might say—at Uncle
Sam’s command.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, I guessed you’d sailed a ship. Do you—did
you know the Greens?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Greens? There’s Greens all over the Cape.
But I reckon I know ’most everyone in these parts
and if I don’t, Elizy does—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Ezekiel Green sailed the <i>Betsy King</i>—”
enlightened Sidney.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Old Zeke? Why, sure as spatter! Well, well!
I might say I was brought up on stories about Zeke
Green. My father overhauled the <i>Betsy King</i> for
Zeke. Zeke’s folks any folks of yours?” turning
suddenly to Sidney.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney explained that they were—that she was
Sidney Romley of Middletown, going now to visit
her Cousin Achsa, whom she had never seen and
of whom she knew little.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You don’t say. My, my, comin’ all this way.
So Achsa’s livin’, is she? Zeke’s boy died, near as
I can remember. I rec’lect a benefit they had for his
widow. She was a Wellfleet girl. Seems to me
she died, too. Yes, she did—suddenly, when her
baby was born. Can’t rec’lect whether the baby
lived or not. Don’t pay much time to those things,
don’t have to for Elizy does it well enough for the
two of us. Ain’t anything on the Cape Elizy misses.
Comes to me though that I heard her say something
about that kid—sure does. I remember that benefit
like it was last night. I’d just come ashore from a
long v’yage and was rigged from t’mast to mizzen
for a night at Potter’s with the boys and Elizy puts
me into a b’iled shirt and makes me hitch up the
hoss and drive to that benefit. I guess I ought ’er
remember it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >He was too deep in his own reminiscences to
observe the effect of his words upon Sidney. So
Cousin Asabel was dead! And they had had a benefit
for his widow. Sidney did not know just what
a benefit was but the sound of the word connected it
in her brain with the League and the mortgage. She
wished Cap’n Phin Davies could remember whether
the baby had lived or not.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If it had lived—I mean that baby—how old
would it be, now?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh—yes—the baby. Let’s see. That benefit
must a’ been all a’ sixteen or seventeen year ago.
It was the last trip I made on the <i>Valiant</i>. Yep,
the last. Elizy’d know for sartin sure, though. Ain’t
many dates she can’t remember down to the minit.
There’s somethin’ about that kid of Green’s I’ve heard
Elizy tell—” He turned suddenly to Sidney: “You’re
comin’ down to this part of the country to visit what’s
left of your folks hereabouts and you don’t know
nothin’ ’bout them? Seems to me some one ought
’a shipped with you. Now I wish ’twas Elizy and
me you was comin’ to visit. I sartin’ do. Elizy
likes little girls—we’ve often wished we had a boat’s
crew of ’em. What’s the use I tell her of havin’ a
house as big as a four-masted schooner and nary
a chick or a child in it. I tell you, you ask your
auntie or whatever she is to let you come over and
stay a spell with us. Wellfleet ain’t so far. I’ll tell
Elizy. You’ll come, now, won’t you? Anyone can
tell you which is Phin Davies’ house—ain’t any much
finer on the Cape.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Is it square—and white—and on an eminence?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Eh? If it’s a hill you mean, you’re right. I
told Elizy after I’d made my last v’yage she could
build anything she had her heart set on but it’d got
to be where I could smell the harbor. Got a lookout
atop where you can see the boats when they sail
round the Point.” A faintly wistful note shaded the
rugged voice. “You tell folks in Provincetown that
you’re a friend of Cap’n Phin Davies and I guess
you can just about have anything you want in the
town. There’s a few of us old fellows left!”</p>

<p class='c008' >As the train carried them further upon the Cape
a boyish excitement seized the old man. He declared
that, though he’d only been in Boston three or four
days, it was as good as “moorin’ from a long
v’yage.” He pointed out to Sidney the places and
things of interest they were passing. Through his
eyes Sidney saw the beauty of the old, elm-shaped
villages, the rich meadow lands, the low-lying salt
marshes, the sand-bars gleaming against stretches of
blue water. Cap’n Phin Davies seemed to know
something, and it was nearly always funny, about
every one who lived in the quaint houses set here
and there under century old trees. Wellfleet came
all too soon.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Now don’t forget, Missy, you’re coming to
visit old Phin Davies. I’ll tell Elizy. And keep an
eye to wind’ard for those pirates!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gosh all fish hooks,” he exclaimed to his Elizy
a half hour later, as he divested himself of his
Sunday coat and vest and sprawled his great hulk
in his own easy chair, “don’t know as I’ve ever seen
a cuter little girl—and comin’ all this way by herself
to visit what’s left of Zeke Green’s folks.”</p>

<p class='c008' >In her way Elizy Davies registered sincere horror.
“You don’t say! Why, all there <i>is</i> is old
Achsa and that poor Lavender! Now, you don’t
say! The little thing—”</p>

<p class='c008' >With Cap’n Phin’s going Sidney was engulfed
in a terrifying loneliness. The lump swelled in her
throat again. She tried desperately to rally something
of that splendid excitement with which she
had started on her journey, to thrill again over the
assembled belongings in the old satchel, some things
Isolde’s and some Trude’s and some even Vick’s.
The girls had been very kind and generous with her.
But in spite of her valiant efforts her spirits sank
lower and lower. She had come so far, she had sat
through so many lonely hours that all that had happened
back at Middletown seemed now to belong to
someone else—some other Sidney Romley. Strong
within her mounted an apprehension at what awaited
her at her journey’s end.</p>

<p class='c008' >But there was a chance the “baby” <i>had</i> lived;
Cap’n Davies had said it’d be about sixteen. Sidney
hoped it was a boy—a boy cousin would be such fun.
And he’d be more likely to have a boat. In order
to keep from thinking that the low dunes of sand
and marsh, shrouded in twilight haze, through which
they now were passing were very dreary she held
stubbornly to her speculations concerning the “baby.”
She was tired and hungry. The lump was growing
very big and hurt. When, as she finally followed
her fellow passengers off the train and along a bustling
platform she heard a pleasant voice ask: “Is
this Sidney Romley?” she gave an involuntary little
gasp of relief.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, are you my cousin?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Dugald Allan took her bag. “Well, yes, if both
of us belonging to Aunt Achsa can make us cousins.
Are you tired? It’s an endless journey—you think
you are never going to get here, don’t you? Did
you have any fears that you’d just ride off into the
ocean? You had a coolish day.” As he talked he
piloted her through the crowd, a crowd that startled
Sidney after those miles of twilight loneliness. “It’s
always like this toward the week-end,” he apologized.
“But Sunset Lane is quiet enough. I’ve old Dobbin
here and the one-hoss shay. Hoist this up, will you,
Toby?” he addressed a lanky barefooted boy who
slouched upon the driver’s high seat.</p>

<p class='c008' >As they creaked and swayed down the sandy
road Sidney turned searching eyes again upon her
companion.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I mean—are you the baby that was born? You
see, Captain Phin Davies told me—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, you mean Lavender. No—I am not Lavender.
I just live with Aunt Achsa summers;
wouldn’t that make me a—sort of half-nephew?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But there <i>is</i> a cousin?” Sidney drew a quick
breath. “You see everything’s so strange to me
that I have to put it all together, like a picture puzzle.
And it will be <i>nice</i> having someone young in the
picture. Then you’re—you’re—a sort of boarder?”
Her voice rose, hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I suppose so. Though Aunt Achsa holds me
as one of the family and I hope you will, too, when
you get that picture put together. What do you
think of our Cape?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, it’s wonderful! Only—” Sidney had to be
honest. “I didn’t like it so well until Captain Phin
Davies made me see what was so nice about it. You
see I expected to see a stern and rock-bound coast.”</p>

<p class='c008' >At this Allan laughed. “We’ll have to find one
for you, won’t we? Well, wait until you see the
back shore. Toby’s taking a short-cut home. I
expect he knows Aunt Achsa has the finest dinner
you ever tasted waiting for us—we’ll be there in
two seconds now.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Two seconds—and her journey would be over,
her adventure begun. Again that apprehension
mounted sweeping before it even her hope of the
big house on an eminence. She was scarcely
conscious of anything they were passing. The dusk had
deepened, enveloping them like a heavy veil. She
heard her companion say: “This is Sunset Lane.”
Then, with a great jolt, the ancient equipage stopped.
“Here we are—and there’s Aunt Achsa watching
for us!”</p>

<p class='c008' >They were so close to the house that Sidney almost
could have jumped from the step of the carriage
to the threshold. All about her she felt rather than
saw crowding flowers. And in the open door silhouetted
against a glow of lamplight waited a very
small, brown old lady.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ascha Green fluttered out to meet Sidney and
touched the girl with shy hands.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, well, you’re here. Don’t seem true. Let
old Achsa look at you, child. Annie’s girl. Come
in. Come right in. I expect you’re tuckered out
and hungry, too. Lavender, come and meet your
new cousin.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney’s glance shot across the room to the boy
who huddled back of the stove, regarding her with
shy dark eyes. And as quickly it dropped before
what she saw. Ascha Green, watching, sensed her
involuntary shudder.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’s strange,” Aunt Achsa hurried to explain,
a tremble in her voice, “but he’ll make friends fast
’nough. Goodness knows he ain’t talked of much
else than a new cousin’s comin’ sence we got your
letter. This is your room, Sidney, right here handy
and mebbe you’ll like to wash up while I put supper
on the table. Here, take this candle; it’s darkened
up fast.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The “boarder” had already carried Sidney’s
bag into the little room that opened directly out of
the parlor. Aunt Achsa, after bustling her in, closed
the door quickly between them.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was the smallest room Sidney had ever seen.
Why, she could reach out from just where she was
standing and touch the ceiling or anyone of the walls.
And it was the neatest. The small panes of the
window twinkled at her between starched muslin
curtains, coarse but immaculate towels covered the
washstand and the highboy that stood at each side
of the window. Another white towel Achsa had
tacked on the wall behind the washbowl and under
the oval mirror. A cushion, much faded from many
washings, she had tied to the back of the straight
rush-bottomed chair at the foot of the bed. A smell
of strong soap hung in the air.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney could not know that the highboy was
priceless, that the two blue vases which Achsa had
risked leaving on top of it had come from a Spanish
port a century before, that the woven cover on the
bed had the date of its making in one corner, that
the hooked rug on the floor could have brought Achsa
a hundred dollars any time she wanted to sell it; her
eyes were too brimming with tears to notice the
flowers that grew to her window-sill and peeped over
it at her their bright heads nodding to the candle
gleam. The lump that had been growing and growing
mastered her. She drew a long-quivering breath.
She had come all the way from home for <i>this</i>. <i>This</i>
was her great adventure!</p>

<p class='c008' >Oh, it was too humiliating, too cruel! That
dreadful old woman—if she’d only had a broom she
would have looked just like a witch. And in a
few minutes she’d open the door and make her go
out into the kitchen and eat supper with them. They
were going to eat in the kitchen. She had seen
the table. And the boarder—nice people in Middletown
did not keep boarders. And, oh, that dreadful
Lavender and his big eyes, staring at her—that was
the cousin! And she could not telegraph Trude
until tomorrow at the earliest—</p>

<p class='c008' >She could not cry. She must not. If she began
she’d never stop. She knew now that the tears had
been starting deep down within her miles back on
her long journey. Her teeth bit into her quivering
lip. She went to the little window and leaned her face
against its frame. The fragrant salt-laden air
caressed her hot face and soothed her.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Shame on you, Sidney Romley,” she finally muttered.
“Remember you’re fifteen. And you <i>wanted</i>
to come—no one made you! Anyway—” She
addressed a rose that was wagging its pink head at
her in an understanding way and that certainly had
not been there a moment before! “Anyway, I’ll bet
it won’t be a <i>bit</i> worse than traveling with fat, cross
old Godmother Jocelyn!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />MR. DUGALD EXPLAINS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Sidney had fallen asleep on that first night at
Cousin Achsa’s with the resolution to escape at the
earliest moment possible from her humiliating situation;
she would telegraph Trude in the morning.</p>

<p class='c008' >But with errant sunbeams, as yellow as gold,
dancing across one’s face, with a tang of salt and
pine in the air, fifteen is certain to rise up strong-hearted,
despite all accumulated woe. Forgetting her
bitter disappointment of the night before Sidney
sprang from her bed and rushed to the window to
look out upon her new surroundings.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was not really much she could see, for the
lane turned at Mrs. Ephraim Calkins’ house and
beyond her house a hillock of sand rose steeply to an
azure blue sky. But Aunt Achsa’s riotous flowers
were smiling their brightest, at the opening of the
hedge crouched Nip and Tuck regarding the morning
with dignified satisfaction, over everything shone
the alluring sun.</p>

<p class='c008' >A sudden whiff of tobacco caught Sidney’s attention.
At the same moment the boarder emerged from
the back of the house and walked slowly along the
clam-shell path that skirted the bit of garden. He
was evidently deep in thought. Suddenly he bent and
picked a flower. As he straightened his glance interrupted
Sidney’s curious speculations.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Good morning, little half-cousin.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Good morning,” Sidney answered, quite cheerfully,
thinking as she spoke that he was nicer looking
in the garden than he had seemed in Cousin Achsa’s
kitchen the night before. “Is it early or late and is
it your pipe that smells so good?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s early. Aunt Achsa has gone on an errand,
for I assured her that you would probably sleep until
noon. You see I’d forgotten that you are—fifteen,
did you say? And that smell—well, it may be the
good Atlantic, or Lav’s basket of fish, which is not
likely. My best bet is that it’s breakfast over at the
Calkins’. I have an idea. I’ll finish this pipe while
you dress, then we’ll run down and meet Aunt Achsa
and incidentally I’ll give you your first glimpse of
the harbor. What say?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney indicated her willingness by drawing her
head in from the frame of roses. She dressed with
haste, splashing the cold water from the bowl over
her face and scarcely disturbing the two braids of
hair. In a few moments she joined the “boarder”
in the garden, rousing him from a frowning contemplation
of the little flower he had picked. At her
“I’m ready” he put it into the pocket of his coat.</p>

<p class='c008' >Unlike Sidney, Dugald Allan had <i>not</i> slept the
night before. Argue as he would he could not shake
the notion that he was responsible for Sidney’s
coming. Because the idea had seemed to please Aunt
Achsa he had encouraged her to invite the girl; to
further humor her he himself had written the letter
that he knew must have given Sidney’s family a
wrong impression of conditions at Aunt Achsa’s.
Its very tone had been unwittingly misleading
He had not thought of that until he had caught the
stricken look on Sidney’s face the night before,
observed her involuntary shrinking from the intimacy
of the supper table.</p>

<p class='c008' >Poor Aunt Achsa, it had been rather a ghastly
supper in spite of all her efforts and her expectations:
Lavender had huddled in his chair with his great
soft eyes on Sidney; Sidney had been too frightened
to eat or to answer by more than a monosyllable
Aunt Achsa’s eager questions; poor Aunt Achsa, in
an agony of shyness and concern had fluttered over
them all. It had been a relief when Sidney, pleading
weariness from her long journey, took her candle
from Aunt Achsa and went to bed. And later Allan
could have sworn he heard the sound of sobbing
from behind that closed door.</p>

<p class='c008' >The whole thing had bothered him and kept him
awake, thinking. And it was not alone Sidney’s disappointment
that moved him. He was stirred by a
strong desire to make the girl know Aunt Achsa as
he knew her, to love the noble spirit in the weather-beaten
old body. Even Lavender. These people
might indeed be his own so quickly did he rise in
their defense. “Well, they <i>are</i> my own!” he muttered.
If this Sidney had been like the other fifteen-year-old
girls who had crossed his path he would not
have bothered, for they could not have been taught
by any process to recognize the gold from the dross;
but she seemed different. And he had caught the
impression that she had come all this way for something
that she had wanted very much to find. Her
disappointment had bordered on the tragic. Well,
it was no business of his, but he’d make amends by
laying off work for a few days and playing around
with her and Lavender.</p>

<p class='c008' >He was a little taken aback when Sidney, clad
in a middy and pleated skirt, for Trude’s last injunction
had been to brush and hang away the new suit
in which she had traveled, joined him, no trace of last
night’s woe on her face. With Nip and Tuck following
they tramped through the sand between the
hollyhocks. Where the lane turned into the beach
road Sidney stopped with a quick, delighted intake of
breath. “Oh, the <i>boats</i>! Aren’t they darling? I
never saw so many. Why, the sails look all pinky!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Dugald Allan explained that this was a trick of
the sun and water. “Sometimes they are green and
sometimes they are gray and deep purple. The fishing
boats are starting out for the grounds. They’ve been
waiting for the tide. That large schooner’s headed
for the banks—I think it’s the <i>Puritan</i>, Jed Starrow’s
new boat. She won’t be back for a week or so. Most
of the others will pull in by dark.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Can I go out on one of them? Oh, you don’t
know how much I want to, I’ve never been in anything
but a rowboat. And I can swim! Has Lavender
a boat?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“One can always find a dory one can use—whenever
he wants one. And Lavender has the <i>Arabella</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008' >It was on the tip of Sidney’s tongue to ask
“What is the <i>Arabella</i>?” and something more of
this Jed Starrow whom she remembered Captain
Phin Davies had mentioned, but another thought
seized her, crowding out all others. From this
boarder who seemed to want to be very nice to her,
she might learn the answer to the riddle that was
perplexing her.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Mr.— Mr.—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Dugald, please. Won’t you treat me like one of
the family?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Mr.—Dugald, I—I want to ask you something.
Prob’ly you’ll think it’s dreadfully rude but—you
see, none of us, my sisters and me, really knew
anything about Cousin Achsa and the Greens except
what we found in a book in our attic—a sort of family
tree book. But I wanted to go somewhere, so I
wrote to her. I didn’t tell my sisters until I got an
answer back. Mr.—Dugald, can letters be awfully
different—from people?”</p>

<p class='c008' >A guilty shiver raced the length of Mr. Dugald’s
spine.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What do you mean?” he parried.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, I mean the letter I got back looked so
<i>nice</i>. It looked as though the person who wrote it
was—well, sort of rich and lived in a big house
and—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Dugald Allan motioned to an overturned dory.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Suppose we sit here where we can see Aunt
Achsa when she comes up the road. Now I’ll make
a confession. <i>I</i> wrote that letter for Aunt Achsa.
She didn’t feel quite up to the mark, her hand shakes
and she’s a little uncertain as to her spelling. I did
not think at the time that I possibly might be giving
you—your family—a wrong impression. Aunt Achsa
was so happy at finding a relative, so touched that
you knew something of her, that I only thought of
furthering her delight. Anyway—” he faced Sidney’s
amazed eyes squarely; “You say you didn’t
know anything of Achsa Green except what you—well,
you might say, dug out of the attic, weren’t you
taking a sporting chance when you came?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney flushed under the challenge in his tone. “I—I
guess so. You see, I’ve never done anything <i>different</i>—like
the other girls have, and I thought it
was <i>my</i> turn to use the—the Egg, we call it. I
wanted adventure. But I think I know what you
mean; I ought not to be disappointed because my
cousins aren’t just what I thought they’d be—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sidney—I’ve lived—well, a little longer than
you have; you see I’ve had a chance to find out a few
things about this world of ours and the people in it.
There’s one kind of an aristocracy that we find
mostly in big cities—it comes up overnight, a sham
thing made over with a gilding of money and wit,
very grand on the outside but when you scratch it a
little you find the common material underneath. Then
there’s an aristocracy that’s the real thing way
through—it’s so real that it doesn’t ever stop to think
that it is an aristocracy. You find that mostly in old,
forgotten, out-of-the-way places—like on Cape Cod.
I think here it’s more solid than the most, though it’s
fast dying; some day it’ll be a thing only of romance.
But the real Cape Coders are descended from pioneer
men who followed the sea for an honest living, who
put bravery and justice and charity and how to live
humanly with their fellows above money. Most of
’em have been crowded out by a different kind of a
commerce than they knew how to deal with; that’s
Lavender’s father’s story; others, the young ones,
have scattered to inland places; some have saved
enough money to keep their positions in their communities,
like Captain Phin Davies; a few like your
Cousin Achsa have nothing but the honor of their
people. Miss Sidney, in your Cousin Achsa’s old body
there is a spirit that has come to her from men who
were like the Vikings of old—she lives by their
standards. She’s never known anything but work
and poverty, but she faces it—square to the wind.
And I’ve never known her to make a complaint or
to utter a begrudging word to or of a soul. Isn’t
that nobility?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I adore the way you say it!” cried Sidney.
“It’s just like the things that come to me to say in
my attic!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Huh? Your—what?” Amazed, Allan looked
at her to see if she were making fun of him. But her
face was alight with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You must think a great deal of Cousin Achsa.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I do. But—wait, I have more I want to say.
You see, I feel responsible on account of that letter—for
your coming here. I want to tell you—about
Lavender. You could not have known—knowing
nothing of any of them—that poor old Lav wasn’t—well,
like other boys.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney flushed. “No, I didn’t. But then I
didn’t know there <i>was</i> a Lavender until I came.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Look here—” Allan drew from his pocket the
flower he had picked up in the garden. “I was
racking my brain for some way to make you see Lavender
as I see him—and then I found this. It was
growing in a corner of the garden where the soil
is poor and the wind harsh and where there isn’t much
sun; see, it’s only half-size and the stem is crooked.
But look into the heart of it—it’s as beautiful as its
fellows. Well—that’s Lavender. After all his poor
little body is only a shell—if the heart of him is fine
and straight, isn’t that all that matters? Like the
blossom of the flower. Can’t you think of Lav
like that?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll try to,” promised Sidney, “and I’m ashamed
dreadfully, to have been so disappointed—about
everything. I’ll take the sporting chance. Of course
Vick would poke no end of fun at me if she knew
how different everything is. But—” with sudden
determination, “Vick shall never know.” Then
Sidney drew a long breath and let her thoughts revert
to the <i>Arabella</i>.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What is the <i>Arabella</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Look beyond that schooner that’s nosing into
the tide.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, that’s a real boat.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, the <i>Arabella’s</i> real enough. But she’s been
pensioned off—you might say; she’s enjoying a peaceful
old age on a sand bar. When the tide is out she’s
high and dry.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“And she belongs to Lavender?” incredulously.</p>

<p class='c008' >Dugald Allan laughed. “The blood of his ancestors
is strong in the boy. He wanted a boat. A
boat of his own—poor lad. He used to hide on the
fishing schooners until they’d clear the Point. So
I bought the <i>Arabella</i> for him. Her owner was going
to chop her up for kindling wood. She serves a good
purpose—and a safe one, moored out there. Lavender
sails the globe on her—and nothing can harm him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, I see—just pretend. But even that’s fun.
Will he let me go with him?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I am sure he will. If you ask him to take you
to the Caribbean Sea on his next voyage you’ll win
him completely.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll help Lavender play the game for I know
lots of different places—though they’re mostly inside
the map.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Dugald Allan was regarding Sidney with thoughtful
eyes. She certainly was not in the least like
the fifteen-year-olds he had assiduously avoided.
“Some kid,” he commented, inwardly. Aloud he
ventured: “Will it be too inquisitive if I ask you
what an Egg is? I see Aunt Achsa coming and I
think you’ll have just time to tell me—unless you’d
rather not.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“An Egg? Oh, you mean <i>my</i> Egg. Of course
you must have thought it funny! Why the Egg’s
the money that comes each year from a book my
father wrote—Goosefeathers. He was always
ashamed of it. So we—my sisters, you see, take
turns spending the money any way we want to. This
is my first turn. Oh, dear, I wasn’t going to tell
a soul.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You don’t mean to say that you have any—well,
objection, to being known as the daughter of
Joseph Romley?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, I’m not <i>ashamed</i>, of course not, for he
was my own dad, and we loved him. Lots of times
he acted just as though he wasn’t a poet. But—but
I wanted to be my own self; that was to be part
of my adventure. You see its awfully stupid always
having to remember to act like a poet’s daughter;
at least it is for Victoria and me—my older sisters
are so used to it that they do it naturally—”</p>

<p class='c008' >But the astonishing boarder interrupted her with
a roar of laughter. In fact, he seemed so amused
and even delighted at something that he could not
control his mirth. “You <i>are</i> the funniest kid!”
Then he had to laugh again. “Did you say you
were—only fifteen? And just how do poets’
daughters <i>have</i> to act, anyway? I’ve only known—one.
Well, I’ll keep your secret. Only you’ll
let me talk about it with you once in a while, won’t
you? With everyone else you shall be as ‘different’
as your heart desires. I don’t believe Aunt Achsa
knows. Now, let’s go and meet her and assure her
that you are ready for the biggest breakfast she can
give you!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“And do you think we can go out on the <i>Arabella</i>
today?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c006'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />SIDNEY TELLS “DOROTHEA”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >After all Sidney never sent the telegram to
Trude. But it must not be thought that all in a
moment she adapted herself to her new surroundings,
or saw Cousin Achsa as the “boarder” had pictured
her; her anticipations had soared too high, on the
wings of too agile an imagination, to surrender at
once to their downfall. Even Dugald Allan she
regarded with inward skepticism.</p>

<p class='c008' >How she rebuilt her small world can be chronicled
best by peeping over her shoulder one afternoon, the
third day after her coming, as she wrote in her
precious “Dorothea” book. At the last moment
she had brought this with her, moved by a doubt
as to the wisdom of leaving it behind; there was no
knowing what liberties the Leaguers, left alone,
might take.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Dorothea Mine, you do not know how it comforts
me to feel your dear pages. I am not alone for
you are with me. And when I think how I almost
left you at home. There is so much to write that I
scarcely know where to begin and must needs sit
with my pen suspended. This is the funniest place
I ever saw but no one, absolutely no one but you,
dear bosom friend, shall ever know that. I mean
it is funny because everything is just the opposite of
what I expected it to be. I had thought, you see, that
our relatives probably lived in a big white square
house high up on a rock-bound coast against which
the waves dashed in foamy crests. That’s the way
I wanted the house to look. And instead it is very
small and all wigglety, with sand hills around it.
But it is cute for the rooms are small like a doll’s
house. There is a kitchen in which we do everything
which I did not like at first only it is a different
kitchen and there is not any other place anyway for
the parlor is so stiff and dressed-up looking that it
would be shocking to muss it up. The kitchen smells
good and shines it is so clean and there is a door
that opens right out into the flowers. I shall not
say much about Cousin Achsa because Dugald, who
is the boarder, says that she is an aristocrat of solid
material and he must know because he has lived
here summers for a very long time. But she talks
bad English like Huldah only she says ‘I swum,’
instead of ‘Yah!’ And she is queer looking but
then all is not gold that glitters. But she is very
kind to me and I think likes me and she cooks the
grandest things and so much. She works all the
time. I do not think I ever saw anyone who could
work so fast. She is like she was wound up inside
and had to keep working until she ran down.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But pour out my heart I must about Lavender
who is my cousin. You see I did not know I had a
young cousin until Phin Davies (of him I will record
later), told me of the benefit and of the baby
who would be sixteen now, he said. Then I became
greatly excited in anticipation of a cousin about my
own age to play with. And oh, what did I find! But
only once will I truly describe him for I have promised
Mr. Dugald to think of Lavender as the poor flower
on the crooked stem and I make myself shut my
inside eyes so that I cannot see that he is different.
He is small for he only comes to my ears and his
arms hang way down and he has funny, long fingers
and one shoulder is higher than the other and he has
a hump on his back. There, I have written the truth.
Now I will remember the flower. Lavender has beautiful
and very wise eyes and a low voice that sounds
like music and a lovely name, like a name in a
languishing novel. And he is dreadfully smart, and
gets it all from the lots and lots of books which he
reads to make up for not going to school. I suppose
he hates to go to school and anyway his mind
is working all the while other boys are playing
ball and doing things he can’t do. At least
Mr. Dugald thinks it’s that way. Mr. Dugald told
me how to win Lavender’s affection for he is terribly
shy and that was by making a great fuss over Nip
and Tuck who are the cats and Lavender is passionately
fond of the cats. That was hard, too, for we
never had any cats as you know and the only cat
I ever touched was Mrs. Jordan’s old Tommy when
I wanted him in a play Nancy and I were going
to give in the attic and he scratched me. But I
bravely took Nip and Tuck in my arms and you would
have been surprised if you could have seen how
beatified Lavender looked. At least that’s the way
Mr. Dugald said he looked afterwards. And he has
liked me ever since. I mean Lavender, of course.
I must digress to say a word of Nip and Tuck. They
are extraordinary cats. They are quite old and big
and black and I think they are solid aristocrats, too,
and you can only tell them apart by a nick in Nip’s
ear that he got in a fight. They can lick any dog or
cat in this part of Provincetown. They are terrors.
And they are twins, I forgot to say. And they do
the same things all the time like the Crooker twins
at school. Lavender loves all animals. He is always
bringing home some stray thing only Nip and Tuck
will not let them stay and that makes Lavender sad.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But I must not spend all my time telling you of
my cousins and the cats when there is so much terribly
exciting to write about. This is the most different
place I ever knew. It is all sand and the
houses look like doll’s houses most of them and come
right out to the funniest little streets that are not
much wider that our sidewalks at home and all the
nice houses have flowers around them somewhere.
And they are mostly a lovely shiny gray that is pinky
in the sun. Mr. Dugald says they get that way from
the salt in the air and that most of the old houses
were shingled from the wood that was in old masts.
And he says the reason flowers grow brighter and
bigger here is because years ago the ships used plain
earth for ballast and changed it when they got into
the harbor and that there is soil right here in
Provincetown from almost every corner of the world.
I held a handful from Cousin Achsa’s garden and
pretended I knew it was from Algiers. There are
a lot of stores on the Main street and some are
like the stores home and Mr. Dugald says they are
a shame. It is hard to walk on the sidewalk because
it is so narrow and most of the time you have to
walk in the street. And everybody talks to everybody
else whether they know them or not or if they do
not talk they smile. There are lots of Portuguese
and they have beautiful eyes and lovely voices like
Isolde’s. I think Mr. Dugald means it’s them who
have crowded out the solid aristocracy, but they are
nice for they make it seem just like I was in a foreign
land. But most, most of all, I like the docks.
Mr. Dugald laughs at me when I call them docks;
but I always forget to call them wharves. They are
all gray and crookedy, as though they were leaning
against one another and when the tide goes out it
leaves the posts all shiny and green. And there are
funny little houses all along the edge of the beach
that are something like the boathouses of Cascade
Lake, only more interesting and people live right
in them and have flower boxes all around them and
fix up weeny verandas over the water and go in
bathing right out of their front doors. And some
of them are fish lofts only Mr. Dugald says that
consolidated companies (I do not exactly know what
he means but will write it because he said it) have
bought out all the small fish companies and that
means that the men do not get enough for their
‘catch’ to pay for the expense and danger of their
going out to sea. He says the Portuguese are satisfied
to only get a little. Everyone knows Lavender
and they let him go anywhere and on to the boats
and everything and I follow him, though at first the
little rowboats which Mr. Dugald calls dorys smelled
so that it made me sick. But I did not want even
Lavender to think I was afraid so I held my nose
inside and went wherever he did. I cannot wear
anything but my old clothes—but no one dresses up
here like Pola probably does, which is
a disappointment, for Vick let me bring her cherry
crêpe de chine for she is very sure Godmother Jocelyn
will get her some new dresses and I am simply
dying to wear it.</p>

<p class='c008' >“And now I must tell you about the good ship
<i>Arabella</i>. It is a very old boat—I think it is a
schooner—and Mr. Dugald says it has probably been
in every port in the world. When it got too old
to sail any more Mr. Dugald bought it for Lavender.
And it is all Lavender’s own. I am sure I never
heard of anyone before having a real big boat just
to play on. But, then, Lavender is different. It is
fastened with a great big anchor and can’t move
only when the water is in it swings around on it just
as though it was going. And when the water is out
the boat is up real high and looks so funny and
lopsided, like that dreadful old drunken man who
walked past school one day. Mr. Dugald
and Lavender took me out to the <i>Arabella</i> the very
first day. We went out in a rowboat—I mean
dory, and Mr. Dugald rowed. Oh, it was so thrilling,
my heart sang within my breast. It seemed as
though I was going far out to sea and the little
waves danced and were so blue and everything smelled
so salty and there were boats all around and some
of them moving with big sails and a three-masted
schooner went right close to us—I mean we went
right close to it because it was fastened—and I could
breathe only with difficulty I was so excited. Dear
friend—at that moment I said to myself I did not
mind my relatives not living in a big house on an
eminence. This, meaning all the boats and the lovely
docks and things, is worth my quest. It was very
hazardous climbing on to the <i>Arabella</i> for it wiggled
so but at last we were on and then!—Oh! <a id='pirate' />Do you
know, it was like a pirate’s ship. And it has a wheel
and a little house and the cutest cabins downstairs
and a funny little kitchen. I am going to ask Aunt
Achsa—I have decided to call her that because she
seems too old to be a cousin—to let me cook out on
the <i>Arabella</i>. Mr. Dugald will not let Lavender cook
on it for fear he will set the boat on fire. It would
be funny to have a boat burn right in the water, but
then I have read of ships that burned at sea. Mr.
Dugald has fixed everything up real nice and he
goes out a lot and draws. He says that as long as I
know how to swim I can go out anytime with Lavender.
It is certainly the most different thing I ever
dreamed of doing and next best to sailing far away
on a young boat. The boat rocked like a cradle
and we laid down on the deck in the sun and it was
a delightful sensation. I am going to take books
out there and I will sometime take you, dear friend,
and write in you as I rock upon the bosom of the
ocean—though this is a bay it is ocean water.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Next most exciting to the <i>Arabella</i> was going to
the backside which is what they call the other side
of the Cape the side that is on the outside on the
map. We tramped over for Mr. Dugald says that
is the only way to navigate on Cape Cod. It was not
the least bit hot for there was such a lovely breeze
and the road is hard and right through sand hills
that looked awfully big and just have a little grass
on them and funny little trees. Mr. Dugald told
me that the heavy winds keep shifting the sand
and that after ever and ever so many years the whole
Cape will be moved and maybe was somewhere else
a long time ago and the State of Massachusetts is
planting a lot of pine trees to hold it where it is now
and that the reason the trees look so small is that
every fall and winter when the big storms come they
blow the sand over them until they are almost buried.
I suppose if one could dig down you would find
a big tree. Mr. Dugald told me all this as we walked
over the dunes. He told me how after one big
storm years and years ago the school children went
to school and found it buried under sand right up
to the roof. I wish that would happen to my school.
But that is how different this place is. Well, we
finally came to a ridge of sand that was bigger and
higher than any of the others so that it took my
breath to climb it like the trail back of Cascade and
then when I got to the top it was so beautiful that
I felt hurt inside and felt afraid. Before me, dear
friend, swept the endless ocean. And as far as eye
could see there was naught but sand. And you
seemed close enough to the blue in the sky to touch
it. You felt it the way you do the furnace when
you go into the furnace room. And not a living
being anywhere around, except us. And the beach
is the loveliest beach I ever dreamed of—and you
see it is the first real beach I have ever seen. It is
wide and hard and part of it is wet where the
big waves roll in and it moans beautifully. And
there are lots of little funny flowers, like wild sweet
peas, and pretty grasses grow on it and the sand
up away from the water is white and glistens like
jewels. I did not like to go near the water at first
for the waves looked like angry monsters with tossing
white manes tearing in at me with their arms
raised to clutch me. But I kept close to Mr. Dugald
who sometimes goes in swimming right in the breakers.
And he pointed out the Coast Guard Station
which was a cute little white house nestled in the
sand dunes and he told me there was a man up
in the square tower who was watching us and every
move we made and if a wave did catch us he’d give
the alarm and a lifeguard would dash out in a
minute and save us. That would be very exciting
but it did not tempt me. We picked up beautiful
shells on the beach and I poked a horrid jelly fish
and then we visited the Station where the men were
very nice and showed us everything. The big man
who is Commander Nelson told us how the sand
when it blows against the windows of the house
turns the glass all funny and frosted so that you
cannot see out of it, and he said they have to keep
putting in new glass every few days. And Mr.
Dugald told me as we walked back how the men from
the Coast Guard Stations patrol the shores of our
country so that there is not a bit of our seacoast
that is not guarded. One starts out from one station
and meets another from another station and
they exchange little checks which they take back so
that their commanders know they have been all the
way. Is it not a lovely feeling to think that as we
sleep someone is watching our shores by night?
Only I wonder how if there are any pirates, and Captain
Davies said there still were, they can land anywhere
without one of these guards seeing them.
Maybe they wait until the watchmen start back with
their checks.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I must now tell you of my new acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c008' >“First there is Aunt Achsa and Lavender of
whom I have written. Second, there is the boarder.
His name is Dugald Allan which I think is a perfectly
lovely name. I am sorry to say he is an artist. I
would have preferred that he had been a fisherman.
When I told him that he laughed very hard. He
laughs at me a great deal which I did not like at
first and then I decided it is his nature and he cannot
help it. He spends every summer with Aunt Achsa
and says he is her half-nephew. Even though he
gave the <i>Arabella</i> to Lavender I think he must be
a poor artist because his clothes look old and have
no style. He knows everyone and everyone calls
him Dug. At first I thought it was horrid visiting
a relative who kept boarders but afterwards I learned
that here in Provincetown someone else lives in nearly
all the houses besides the families, because they are
not nearly enough houses for all the people who want
to come to Provincetown. Mr. Dugald says that
artists and poets and musicians come here from all
over the world for the inspiration. I cannot tell the
men artists from the fishermen for they wear things
like sailors but the women artists all wear big hats
and smocks all covered with paint. I am sure I saw
a poet yesterday and I do not know what a musician
would look like and Mr. Dugald said he did not know,
either. That was one of the times when he laughed.
But I said then and repeat now that there are enough
other people around so that I do not mind the artists
and poets.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Third of my acquaintance is Captain Phin
Davies. Aunt Achsa says he is very rich, that he was
smart enough to buy up a lot of fishing boats and a
storage house of his own and he could laugh at the
Boston and New York people. But he used to sail a
boat like Cousin Zeke’s which is what they call my
relative. And he is very, very nice and invited me to
go to Wellfleet and visit him and his wife and Aunt
Achsa says she does not see no harm in my going.
Aunt Achsa’s grammar is so bad that I blush to write
it here.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Fourth, Martie Calkins who is Mrs. Eph Calkins’
granddaughter and lives in the house next to
Aunt Achsa’s. She is very different from the girls I
know at school and Nancy would shudder if she saw
her for Nancy is so sensitive, but then this is not Middletown
and I am sensitive like Nancy and Mart is
just my age and she can go out on the <i>Arabella</i> with
us, though she told me confidentially that her grandmother
thought Achsa Green stark daffy to trust
Lavender out of her sight. Mart does not think
about Lavender the way Mr. Dugald taught me to
think. She can tell the grandest stories of the sea
because her father and grandfather were fishermen
who went out on big boats and her father was lost
at sea so she is an aristocrat, too. She is going to
show me how to dig clams tomorrow. And we are
going to the moving pictures on Saturday. It seems
very queer and like home to have moving pictures
here but Mr. Dugald says they are like the poor. To
quote him exactly, ‘Alas, the movies—like the poor,
we have always with us!’ He says very queer things.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Fifth, Miss Letitia Vine, a most picturesque
character. I quoted Mr. Dugald then for I did not
know people could be picturesque. No one but Miss
Letty herself knows how old she is and she won’t tell.
Aunt Achsa said she paid to have the date and year
of her mother’s death scratched off her tombstone
so folks couldn’t figure out her age. But she is
very cultured and is a music teacher, only a funny
one. She drives all over this part of the Cape and
gives music lessons. She has done it for years and
years, Aunt Achsa calculates she has worn out three
horses teaching folks their notes. She stays in one
town two or three days sleeping round with her pupils
and then hitches up and drives to the next. She
scorns a Ford. Mr. Dugald says he’s thankful for
that for a Ford would spoil the most perfect thing on
the Cape. She looks like the figurehead of a ship
(again quoting Mr. Dugald) and she isn’t afraid
of man or beast. She and Mr. Dugald are very good
friends and Mr. Dugald took me there to call and I
think he told her that I was the daughter of a poet,
because she looked at me like that though he had
promised not to and I hate to think he broke his promise.
She has very interesting things in her house
that she has picked up from all over the Cape as she
gave her music lessons. I guess she does not have
many pupils now but Aunt Achsa said Letty Vine
would have to die in the harness so that is probably
why she keeps going.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sixth is Mr. Commander Nelson at the Coast
Guard Station who invited me to come to see him
again. He said if he needed a hand at any time
he’d send for me. It would be exciting to help save
souls from a wreck at sea. I would like to even see
one though that sounds wicked and I must curb my
thirst for adventure.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Jed Starrows is not an acquaintance but I intend
to know more about him. When anyone speaks
of him they put such a funny tone in their voices.
I asked Mr. Dugald if he is aristocratic too and he
laughed and said he most certainly is not. But he
owns a big boat—an auxiliary schooner that is the
fastest one here and he has just bought out a fish
company and Aunt Achsa says it beats everything
where he gets his money because he wasn’t much
more than a common clam-digger a year or so ago.
But I will record here that Captain Davies spoke of
Jed Starrows as though he might know something
about pirates and I mean to find out if I can.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Enough now, dear friend—my arm aches and I
must stop. Adieu for the nonce—”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c006'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />MAIDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >And later Sidney wrote the following letter to
her sisters.</p>

<p class='c013' >“Dear Family:</p>

<p class='c011' >“I have not written before because everything is
so marvellously exciting. My telegram told you
that I had arrived safely at Cousin Achsa’s. The
hours of my journey, all too short, sped on wings
of happiness. Thus they are still speeding. This
is the loveliest and the unusualest place and it is filled
with quaint homes and the most interesting people.
Our relatives are among the most aristocratic and
Aunt Achsa, she wants me to call her that, is of the
proudest blood of Cape Cod. She is very nice to
me and asks a great many questions about you all
and about our mother. She has a nephew who lives
here who is only a year older than I am. And a family
friend of Aunt Achsa’s lives here summers and he
takes Lavender (which is our cousin’s name) and me
out on a big boat which is most exciting.</p>

<p class='c011' >“There is a girl about my own age who lives right
next door and I think we will be very good friends.
She is not at all like Nancy which I am glad as variety
is the sauce of living. She is of pure Cape Cod
blood, too.</p>

<p class='c011' >“If I do not write often and only very little letters
it is because I’m so busy, for I must make the most of
every minute. I wish you would write to me an
awful lot though and please send all of Vick’s letters
to me so that I will know what she’s doing just as
though I was home, and Trude, <i>you</i> write every day.
And when you write to Vick tell her that I am having
the most wonderful time. Be sure to do that. Loads
and loads of love,</p>

<div class='c014'>“Your sister, Sidney.”</div>

<p class='c012' >Kneeling against a half-packed trunk, Trude
read Sidney’s letter aloud to Isolde. Victoria had
gone the day before.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What do you think?” Trude asked, slowly, as
she finished.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Think? What do you mean? I’m glad the
child’s there safe and happy.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But, Issy, that letter doesn’t ring just—true.
I know how Sid usually writes and talks. It’s too
brief and there’s something, well—forced about it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Isolde put down a box of papers she had been
sorting over. Her conscience had troubled her not
a little at letting Sidney go off alone among strangers,
even though they were relatives, and now Trude’s
doubts sharpened the pricks.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Forced? I didn’t notice it. It was short, of
course, but probably she is having too good a time to
write a longer letter. Anyway, Trude, she’s there safe,
and we’re almost packed and our tickets are bought—it
isn’t going to do anyone a bit of good, now, to upset
all our plans and bring Sid home. That’s the way I
look at it. And she would have been perfectly
wretched here with the League Convention filling the
house. It’s dreadful to contemplate.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I can’t bear to think of Sid going out on boats
with a harum-scarum boy—” Trude groaned.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t feel half as concerned over the boats
as I do wondering if living there in luxury may not
spoil her for her own poor home—make her dissatisfied.
She is probably meeting all the wealthy
summer people—there are a lot on the Cape, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude was still studying the letter as though to
find something between the written lines.</p>

<p class='c008' >“She wants me to write every day. That sounds
a little homesicky. Well, I will, bless the kid’s heart—no
matter how rushed I am. And I will warn her
in every letter to be careful around the boats. And
not to get her head turned by our relatives’ high
estate, either. Isn’t it funny, Issy, that we never
knew they were wealthy—until now? Not that it
would have made a bit of difference with Mother or
Dad,” she finished, defensively.</p>

<p class='c008' >Isolde, her conscience quieted for the hundreth
time, turned her attention to her box. She lifted
out a small packet of letters tied together and handed
them to Trude.</p>

<p class='c008' >“These are yours.”</p>

<p class='c008' >One slipped from the packet and fell to the floor
between the two girls. Trude picked it up quickly,
a deep crimson sweeping her face.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, it’s one of <i>those letters</i>—” exclaimed
Isolde, accusingly.</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude nodded, guiltily. “I know it. I—I
couldn’t bear to destroy them all.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Trude, dear, you don’t care anything about that
man—now?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude forced a light laugh but her eyes avoided
Isolde’s searching glance. “Why, no—at least not
in <i>that</i> way. If you like things in a person very
much you just have to keep on liking them no matter
what happens. And, Issy, it wasn’t his fault that
I—I imagined—he cared—for me—” Her voice
broke. Isolde gave a quick little cry.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Trude, you <i>do</i> care! And he isn’t worth the
tiniest heartache. He <i>must</i> have led you on to think
things. And all the time he was playing with you.
It makes me <i>furious</i>! You’re such an old peach.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The “old peach” made no answer. There flashed
across her mind all that Isolde had had to say before
about this man; every fibre of her being shrank from
a repetition that would bring pain as well as humiliation.
She straightened.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We are a couple of geese to dig all this up now.
I was just sentimental enough to hang on to one of
the letters—I suppose it’s because they are the only
letters I’ve ever had from a man—but I see my
mistake now. I will destroy it.” She slipped the letter
into her pocket with the tiniest sigh. “So there.”
(But the letter was not destroyed.)</p>

<p class='c008' >“I wish you’d meet someone down at the Whites’—some
perfectly grand man. I should think Uncle
Jasper would realize—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Isolde’s tone was so tragic that Trude laughed,
now with genuine amusement. “I was thinking of
some of Uncle Jasper’s friends,” she explained.
“They are mostly nice, fat settled bankers and lawyers,
but if any bachelor doctors, tinkers or tailors
slip in I promise to flirt desperately—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Trude, you think I am joking and I am not.
If you don’t meet someone at the Whites’ where <i>will</i>
you meet him? What chance have you and I, shut up
here, to know the kind of men we’d—we’d like to
know? Do you think I enjoy the namby-pamby
sort that flock here to sit in Dad’s chair? No, indeed.
And Trude—I’m—twenty-six next October! <i>I’m—an
old maid!</i>”</p>

<p class='c008' >Before Isolde’s earnestness Trude unknowingly
lowered her voice to a soft note. “Do you feel
like that, too, Issy? I’ve felt that way often. I’m
twenty-four. But I’m not afraid of being an old
maid—I’ve always sort of known I’d be one—but I
catch myself just longing to do <i>something</i> with my
life, different—as little Sid put it. Then I chastise
myself severely for my repinings. Anyway, it’ll be
fun watching Vick’s and Sid’s experiences, won’t it?
Bless them, they seem to have escaped our bounds,
don’t they?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I am afraid my vicarious enjoyment of their
adventures may be tempered with a little jealousy.
I am not as noble as you are, Trude. It is hard to
think that you and I have to go on sitting still and
watching our lives go by—and our one and only
life, remember!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude shook herself a little—perhaps she was
“chastising” her inner spirit. “Come, we mustn’t
get mopey on the eve of a holiday. They’re too rare
to spoil. And two trunks still to pack. Do you
think the Leaguers will mind if we shroud that painting
in the living-room. It’s the best thing we own
and I hate to have it get too dusty.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Isolde lifted her shoulders rebelliously. “I
don’t know what has happened to me but, do you
know, Trude, I am beginning to think it’s the limit
that we have to consider the League in even a little
thing like that. Thank goodness we <i>are</i> going to
have a holiday! But I wonder if the summer will
bring anything to any of us.”</p>

<p class='c008' >In answer Trude smiled down into the trunk.
“Well—it’s bringing something to Sid. Rather she
went out and got it. And it surely will to Vick, new
clothes if nothing more. And I hope it will to you,
too, Issy, dear, something grand and—contenting.”</p>

<p class='c008' >It was typical of Trude that she did not think
of herself.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c006'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />INDEPENDENCE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“Golly day, but I’m tired!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Martie Calkins threw herself on the cool sand of
the beach and gave vent to a long breath. Sidney,
standing over her, wished she could do likewise with
the same picturesque abandon. Mart was so splendidly
“I don’t care a hang”; her tumbled hair now
was thick with sand, across her tanned face was a
smear of black, her shabby blouse was torn and open
at the throat exposing her chest to the hot sun, her
bare, hard-muscled legs were outstretched, the heels
digging into the sand and the grimy toes separating
and curling like the tentacles of a crab.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, this is the life,” she sang. “Sit down and
make yourself at home. This beach’s yours as much
as mine I guess.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney sat down quickly lest her companion guess
how she was tied inside with the innumerable bonds
and knots of conventions, century old, which Martie
had somehow escaped. Of course Sidney herself
did not think it that way; she only knew that she
felt ridiculously awkward with Martie Calkins in
spite of her growing determination to be just like her.</p>

<p class='c008' >They had been friends now for two whole weeks,
the shortest two weeks Sidney had ever known simply
because into them they had crowded so much. She
had met Mart the day after her coming to Sunset
Lane. Mart had appeared at Aunt Achsa’s with
some baking soda her grandmother had borrowed
two months before. Aunt Achsa had said: “I
cal’late you two girls better make friends.” That
was so obviously sensible that Sidney quickly put
from her the impression that Mart was the “queerest”
girl she had ever met. She had <i>seen</i> queerer but
had never <i>talked</i> to them. But Mart was young and
frankly friendly and lived next door and, anyway,
everything was so very different here that it was
ridiculous to expect to meet a girl like Nancy or the
others at school or perfect like Pola.</p>

<p class='c008' >Before Mart’s experience, her knowledge of the
sea and boats, her background of seafaring ancestors,
her easy assurance, Sidney’s pleasant sense of superiority
soon went crash. Too, Mart revealed a quality
of strongheartedness and a contentment with everything
as it came along that amazed Sidney at the same
time that it put her own restlessness to shame. Why,
Mart, in all her life, had never been farther than
Falmouth and had gone there to a funeral, but she
had none of Sidney’s yearnings to “see places.”
Pressed by Sidney’s inquiries she had answered, with
a deceiving indifference: “Oh, what’s the use of
wanting to go anywhere, it’s nice enough here.”
Nor did Mart’s multitudinous tasks embarrass her;
she would keep Sidney waiting while she finished
scrubbing the kitchen floor. And she had a way of
swishing her brush that made even this homely labor
seem like play until Sidney, watching from the
safety of a chair, her feet securely tucked between
its rungs, longed to roll up her own sleeves and thrust
her arms into the sudsy water. Martie had to work
much harder than any girl Sidney had ever known or
heard about; she did a man’s work and a woman’s
work about her home and did not even think it was
out of kindly proportion to her years. “Oh, there’s
just gran’ma and me and she has rheumatiz awful,”
she had explained just once to Sidney. That was
why, of course, Martie looked so unkempt and overgrown
and had had so little schooling, but Sidney
came to think these shortcomings and their cause
made Martie the more interesting.</p>

<p class='c008' >Though after a week Sidney could toss her head
like Mart, run as fast, go barefooted, sprinkle her
chatter with a colloquial slang that would have horrified
the League, affect ignorance to anything
schooly, she found that it was not easy to emulate
Mart’s fine independence. There was always that feeling
of being tied to the things ingrained within her.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mart’s ease with everyone, young or old, gave
her, in Sidney’s eyes, the desirable quality of grown-upness.
Mart talked to the fishermen and the women
who were her grandmother’s friends and the artists
and the tradespeople exactly as though she were
their equal in point of years; Sidney, marvelling and
admiring, did not know that this assurance was really
a boldness that had grown naturally out of there
just being “gran’ma and me.” Martie had had to
hold her own since she was six years old.</p>

<p class='c008' >Though from the first day of her coming Sidney,
moved by a sense of the courtesy to be expected from
a guest, had insisted that they include Lavender in
all their plans, at the same time she had wished that
he would refuse for she could not conquer a shyness
with him. He was a boy and she had never known
any boys very well, and he was a “different” boy.
But Mart did not mind him at all; she played tolerantly
with him, quarreled cheerfully and bitterly
with him, laughed with him and at him exactly as
though he were a girl like herself or she the boy that
she should have been, gran’ma considered.</p>

<p class='c008' >On this day Mr. Dugald had taken Lavender to
the backside. He had not invited the girls to join
them which had roused Sidney’s curiosity. She had
watched them depart, loaded down with books and
stools and an easel and a box of lunch and had wondered
what they were going to do all day, alone, in
the dunes. She was soon to know that those hours
were sacred to Lavender, that in the great silences
of the sandy stretches he and his Mr. Dugald with
their books went far from the Cape and Sunset Lane
and the crooked body.</p>

<p class='c008' >The girls, left to themselves, had decided to go
clamming. Of all the novel things she had done in
the last two weeks Sidney liked clamming best. It
was even more fun than the <i>Arabella</i> for after all the
<i>Arabella</i> was only pretend. She liked to feel her
bare toes suck up the goosy sand as she stepped over
the wet beds. She could never dig as fast as Mart or
Lavender because she had to stop and watch the sky
and the clouds and the moving sails and the swooping
seagulls. “You’d never make a living digging
clams,” Martie had scolded. (Mart herself could
dig faster than old Jake Newberry who had peddled
clams through the town for fifty years. Mart had
sometimes sold hers at the hotels.)</p>

<p class='c008' >“There’s so much to <i>look</i> at!” Sidney had
answered, drawing in a long happy breath.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Look</i> at! What? All I can see is sky and
water and a lot of that and that ain’t nothing new.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But it is always different! The sky gets bluer
and the clouds pinker and the water dances just as
though there were sprites hiding in each wave.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee, anyone ’ud think you were a poet!” Mart
had laughed and at that Sidney had fallen hastily
to digging.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, as they lay on the beach, hot and happy,
their basket of clams between them, Sidney’s
thoughts went back to Lavender’s and Mr. Dugald’s
mysterious departure.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’ve had just as much fun,” she declared,
aloud.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What d’you mean? Oh—Lav. Pooh, yes.
Who’d want t’go off in the sand and sit in the hot
sun all day? <i>I</i> wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aunt Achsa packed them an awfully good
lunch,” Sidney reflected.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure she did. She spoils Lav like anything.
Gran’ma says it’s a shame. And what <i>she</i> doesn’t
spoil that boarder does.”</p>

<p class='c008' >For an instant Sidney flared with resentment at
her companion’s tone. However she realized that
she was at a disadvantage in that she had only known
these people for only two weeks and Mart for her
whole lifetime.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What do you s’pose they do over there?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Mart shrugged her shoulders. “I used to be
curious but I’m not any more. They go off somewhere
like that together all the time, packed up ’sif
they were headin’ for a whole winter’s cruise. I
guess I know. Like as not the boarder’s paintin’
Lav’s picture and Lav don’t want him to do it where
people’ll see on account of his being crooked.” Mart,
satisfied with her explanation, stretched herself luxuriously,
her arms upflung.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney shuddered. “Oh, why should he want
to paint Lavender’s picture? I think he’s cruel!”
Then she remembered Dugald Allan’s allusion to the
flower on the crooked stem. “Maybe he’s painting
Lav’s spirit.”</p>

<p class='c008' >At this Mart raised herself on her elbow, stared
at Sidney, and burst into a loud laugh. “Oh, that’s
the <i>best</i>! Lav’s spirit! Oh, <i>my</i>! You’re the funniest
kid. Say, don’t get sore but I just have to
howl, you’re so rich.” She threw herself back in the
sand and rolled from one side to the other.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney sat very still biting the lips that had
betrayed her. She’d remember after this; she’d
never make another slip that would provoke Mart
to such amusement. Mart began looking hard at
her again and she squirmed uneasily under the scrutiny.
But Mart only asked:</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, ain’t your hair awful hot?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Relieved, Sidney answered promptly, “Yes. I
hate it.” She gave a fling to the heavy braids.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why do you have it then? I’d cut it off. I
cut mine. I wouldn’t be bothered with a lot of hair.
I s’pose your folks would make an awful fuss if you
did, though.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney twisted her bare toes in the sand and
frowned down at them. Yet it was not at their whiteness
she frowned but at a sudden recollection of Mrs.
Milliken’s: “Always wear your hair like that, my
lamb, it is so beautifully quaint.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t know that they’d mind. It’s my own
hair. I’ve thought of having it cut often.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Mart sat upright. “Say, I’ll do it for you—if
you want me to. We can go straight home now.
We’ll divide our clams when we get to our house.
That is if you’re not afraid.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Afraid—of just cutting my hair? I may look
a sight but who cares? I’ll do it. Come on!”
Sidney sprang to her feet, a challenge in her voice
that Mart, of course, could not understand.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mart rose more leisurely and took the dripping
basket of clams and seaweed. They were not far
from Sunset Lane. It took them but a few moments
to reach the Calkins’ house—not long enough for
Sidney’s courage to falter.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gran’ma isn’t home, but anyway she wouldn’t
say anything. She lets me do just as I please. She
never said a word when I cut my own hair. Sit
down here and I’ll find the shears in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney sat down in a rush-bottomed chair, thrilling
pleasantly. This was a high moment in her life—the
clipping of the two despised braids; a declaration
of independence, a symbol of a freedom as great
as Mart’s. And certainly Mart must be impressed
by the way she had responded to the suggestion.
“Afraid!” Well, Mart might laugh at things she
said but she would see that she was quite her
own mistress.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mart returned with a pair of huge shears.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Of course I can’t do it as good as a regular
barber but it’ll be good enough for the first time and
around here, anyway. Sure you don’t mind?
Your hair <i>is</i> dandy!” While she was speaking she
was unbraiding one pigtail. She shook it out. “It’s
awful thick and wavy. Mebbe you could sell it. I’ve
heard of girls doing that but I don’t know’s there’s
any place around here. Sit still, now, so I can get
it straight.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Click. Sidney shut her eyes and sat rigid with
a fearful certainty that she must suffer physical pain
from the operation. Click. The touch of the steel
against her neck sent icy shivers down her spine.</p>

<p class='c008' >“There, now—it’s off,” cried Mart, taking a
step backward. “It’s sort of crooked but that won’t
show when it’s all loose. Go in gran’ma’s room and
take a look at yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney turned and stared stupidly at the mass of
hair in Martie’s hand. It <i>was</i> beautiful hair. For
an instant she wanted to cry out in a violent protest;
she checked it as it rose to her lips. Mart’s eyes
were on her. She managed instead a little laugh.
“It feels so <i>funny</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, you’ll get used to that. You’ll like it.
Take a look now and say I’m some barber.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Gran’ma Calkins’ old mirror, hung where the
light shone strong upon it, reflected back to Sidney
a strange and pleasing image.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why <i>I like it</i>!” she cried, running her fingers
through the mass. “It’s—it’s—so <i>different</i>. It’s
jolly.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You won’t have to bother combing it much,
either. I don’t touch mine sometimes for days.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney, still staring at the stranger in the old
mirror, laughed softly. “Wait until Nancy sees it.
Nancy hair is straight as can be or I’ll bet she’d cut
hers. And Issy. Issy will have a fit when she
knows. And Mrs. Milliken!” Here she broke off
abruptly, not even in her triumph must she give hint
to Mart of the League and its hold upon the house
of Romley. “Oh, I like it!” she repeated exultingly.
“And it won’t be half the bother.” She
felt now that she was Mart’s peer in point of abandon.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You don’t think your Aunt Achsa will make a
fuss, do you?” asked Martie, with tardy concern.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aunt Achsa? Oh, no! At least—” It had
not occurred to Sidney that Aunt Achsa had anything
to say about it. “She lets me do anything.” Which
was quite true. But something of Sidney’s exultance
faded; she was beginning to wish that she had just
said <i>some</i>thing to Aunt Achsa about it before she
let Mart clip her braids—not exactly asked permission
but confided her intentions. That Mart might
not perceive her moment’s perturbation she turned
her attention to the clams.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I ought not to have half for I didn’t find nearly
as many as you did.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, rats. Take ’em. All you want.” To
Mart, who could dig clams faster than old Jake Newberry,
an accurate division of their spoils meant
nothing. To Sidney who dug awkwardly each clam
was a treasure.</p>

<p class='c008' >Her step lagged as she approached Aunt Achsa’s.
She hoped Aunt Achsa would not be home. Then
she wondered why she could not be as confidently
defiant as Martie; she supposed it was the restraint
of the League and the three sisters under whom she
had had to live and Martie had not. But it was
absurd to feel even apprehensive of Aunt Achsa’s
displeasure when Aunt Achsa was such a little thing
and so indefinite a relative.</p>

<p class='c008' >Aunt Achsa was in the kitchen trimming the edge
of a pie. She was holding it high on the tips of her
fingers and skilfully cutting the crust with a small
knife when under it she spied Sidney’s shorn head.
She promptly dropped the pie upon the table upside
down. A trickle of red cherry juice ran out over
the spotless table.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, I <i>swum</i>! Sidney Romley! Wh—what
have you gone and done? What’s ever happened
to you?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“My hair was so hot and <i>such</i> a bother. I can
swim now and won’t have to sit around for an hour
drying it. I <i>hated</i> my braids—” All good arguments
which rang true but did not seem to convince
Aunt Achsa who continued to stare at Sidney with
troubled eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s <i>my</i> hair, Aunt Achsa. If I look a sight
it’s my own fault.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That ain’t it, child. Only—it’s so sudden.
Your—<i>doing</i> it—without a word or—or anything.
What’ll your folks say? I—I—kind a wish you’d
just <i>told</i> me, you see.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney laughed with a lightness she did not feel.
Aunt Achsa eyes were so reproachful, even hurt.
“Why, I did not have time to tell you. I didn’t
think of it myself until a few moments ago. And
Mart offered to do it for me. It’s such a little thing
to make any fuss about.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The cherry juice went on dripping until a big
round stain disfigured the tablecloth and still Aunt
Achsa stared at Sidney with troubled eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s a little thing, of course. But I was thinkin’—Sidney,
promise your Aunt Achsy you won’t go
off and do anything <i>else</i> high-handed like without
tellin’ me. I don’t want to be worryin’ or suspicionin’
what you’re up to or havin’ your sisters blame me for
something that ain’t just right to their thinkin’.
Mebbe we don’t do things same as you do but we
know what’s right and what’s wrong same as anyone.”
Which was a long and stern speech for Aunt
Achsa. She gave a frightened gasp at the end and
turned the poor pie right side up.</p>

<p class='c008' >A dark flush had swept Sidney’s face. There
was no such thing as freedom <i>any</i>where—there must
always be someone in authority somewhere to warn
and rebuke, even this absurd little old woman, who
seemed so remotely related. She wished she could
think of something very withering and at the same
time dignified to retort.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I think I am perfectly capable of knowing what
is right and what is wrong and my sisters have <i>perfect</i>
confidence in me,” she said slowly and with deep
inward satisfaction. Then she added scornfully:
“Of course it <i>is</i> very different here and if I don’t
seem to get used to it you can’t blame me!” With
which she stalked through the parlor to her room and
slammed the door.</p>

<p class='c008' >Aunt Achsa pattered after her.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Child! Child!” she called through the door.
“Here’s a letter for you. I was that taken back
when I saw you I forgot to give it you.” She slipped
the letter through the inch of opening that Sidney,
now tearful, vouchsafed her.</p>

<p class='c008' >The letter was from Trude. To poor Sidney
this was the crowning humiliation; it was exactly as
though Trude could look out from the pages and see
the mutilated locks. Trude had always loved her
hair and had often brushed it for her for the simple
delight of fingering its wavy strands. More than
once Trude had said: “You’re lucky to have this
hair, kid. Look at mine.” Now she would gasp in
horror as Aunt Achsa had done. “You should not
have done it, Sidney—at least without consulting one
of us.” It was not the deed itself even Trude would
censure—it was her independence. Oh, how terribly
difficult it was to be like Mart!</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude had written to her almost daily, sketchy
letters full of the news of what she was doing at the
Whites. Sidney could not know that Trude purposely
made them lively and wrote them often because
she believed Sidney was homesick. In this letter
her concern had reached the height of sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If you’re ready to go home, have had enough
of Cape Cod, just say the word, little sister, and I’ll
join you at Middletown. Perhaps you have been
with Cousin Achsa long enough—you do not want
to impose upon her hospitality. She may have other
friends she wants to invite to her house. But you
must decide at once for Mrs. White is making plans
for the next few weeks and will want to know if I
am going to be here. She is perfectly wonderful to
me and I think she likes to have me here and that I
help her a little, but if you want me to join you at
home she will understand.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why in the world haven’t you written to me?
I shall scold you soundly for that when we are
together. Be a good girl and remember how much
we all love you. I shall expect a letter within three
days at most telling me what you want to do.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney gasped. Her barbered hair, Aunt Achsa,
were forgotten for the moment. Go home—leave
all her fun and Sunset Lane and Mart—and Lavender?
Her consternation gave no room for the
thought that two weeks had indeed worked a strange
conversion. Why, she would sit right down and
write to Trude that she did not <i>want</i> to go home.
That was silly!</p>

<p class='c008' >Then she thought of the hurt on Aunt Achsa’s
face only a few moments before when she had flung
her angry retort at her. And Aunt Achsa had been
so good to her! Why, that cherry pie that had come
to such a disastrous end Aunt Achsa was baking just
because she had said she adored cherry pies. That
was Aunt Achsa’s way of showing affection. That
Aunt Achsa had trusted her—she had given her complete
freedom in the two last whirlwind weeks because
she had <i>trusted</i> her. And how ungrateful, now,
Aunt Achsa must think her. Well, she had punished
her own self for now, of course, Aunt Achsa would
<i>want</i> her to go.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />SIDNEY BELONGS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Sidney was too deep in her slough of despond to
see that behind Mr. Dugald’s shock of surprise was
a smiling admiration of her bobbed head. And even
Lavender avowed at once that it “looked swell.”
Two hours before Sidney would have gloried in
their approval but with Trude’s letter in her pocket
and the humiliating memory of her silly retort to
Aunt Achsa she was beyond feeling pleasure at
anything.</p>

<p class='c008' >She ate her supper in a heavy silence. Lavender’s
and Mr. Dugald’s high spirits seemed to her
as unfitting as jazz at a funeral. She kept her eyes
carefully away from Aunt Achsa’s face and found a
faint solace in only nibbling at the especially delectable
supper until Aunt Achsa asked her anxiously
if she “wa’n’t well?”</p>

<p class='c008' >She felt infinitely far removed, too, from the
curiosity that had obsessed her throughout the day.
It didn’t matter now what Mr. Dugald and Lavender
had been doing over there among the sand dunes!</p>

<p class='c008' >The next morning Lav invited her to go with him
while he helped Cap’n Hawkes take a fishing party
out to the <i>Mabel T</i>. This was one of the odd jobs
Lavender often did around the harbor. Sidney had
gone with him twice before and had thoroughly
enjoyed it. It was fun to sit in the bow of the old
dory and watch the harbor lazily coming to life in
the bright morning sun, sails lifting and dipping to
the breeze, boats swinging at their moorings, the
low roofs of the houses on the shore glistening pink
against the higher ridges of sand, the dancing waves,
their tips touched with gold. She liked to listen
to the noisy chatter of the picnicers, to most of whom
everything was as novel as it was to her; the women
invariably squealed as they climbed aboard the <i>Mabel
T</i> just as she had squealed the first time she boarded
the <i>Arabella</i>. And her greatest thrill came when the
tourists took her for a native, like Lavender, asking
her questions which she invariably answered glibly.</p>

<p class='c008' >This was probably the last time she would go out
in the harbor with Lavender. She thought it, sitting
very still behind a barricade of bait pails and
baskets. She glared at a tanned girl who was telling
her companion that they were going to stay on at the
Cape through August. The brightness of the morning
only deepened her gloom—she could stand
things <i>much</i> better if it were pouring rain.</p>

<p class='c008' >The fishing party and all the paraphernalia shipped
safely aboard the <i>Mabel T</i>, Lavender let the dory
drift as Sidney had begged him to do the first time
she had gone out. He looked at her anticipating her
noisy pleasure only to find her eyes downcast, her
face disconsolate.</p>

<p class='c008' >She felt his glance questioning her and lifted
her head.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ve got to go home.”</p>

<p class='c008' >That he simply stared and said nothing was balm
to her. And she caught, too, the strange expression
that flashed into the boy’s great dark eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I got a letter yesterday from Trude. She
thinks I’ve stayed long enough—that I am imposing
upon Aunt Achsa’s hospitality.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Still Lavender said nothing. Now he was looking
off to where the sails of the <i>Mabel T</i> cut the blue
of the sky like the wings of a great bird.</p>

<p class='c008' >“She wants me to write at once just when I am
going.” Which was of course not <i>exactly</i> the way
Trude had written and yet was the correct interpretation
Sidney now put upon her letter.</p>

<p class='c008' >And still no word from Lavender.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I—I hate to go. Dreadfully. Will you miss
me the least bit, Lav? I—I mean you and Mart—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, <i>hang</i> Mart!” burst out the boy hotly.
“Who cares ’bout her? I can fool ’round with her
<i>any</i>time only I don’t want to. I—I—” He stopped
short with a queer inarticulate sound and Sidney
gasped. Why, Lavender was almost crying!</p>

<p class='c008' >He really <i>was</i> crying only he was swallowing it
all with funny gulps that lifted his crooked shoulders.
Sidney’s heart gave a happy leap.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Lav, I’m so <i>glad</i> you are sorry that I am
going. We have had such fun together and you see
I’ve never known any boys before—oh, except the
ones I’ve met at parties and things and they’re terribly
stupid. But you have been such a peach to
me and showed me how to do everything just as
though I was a boy. I’ll miss you, too, Lav—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, no, you won’t. I mean it isn’t the same,”
muttered Lavender, his shoulders quiet now. Across
his face settled a sullenness that Sidney had never seen
on it. She did not like it; it made him look ugly.
She turned away. The boy went on, in a thick voice.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Y’see, I never do anything with anyone because,
well—I’m different. That’s why. I c’n always see
them lookin’ at me curious or pitying and I won’t
stand it! I just <i>won’t</i>. I hate it. That’s why I
wouldn’t ever go to school. Some of the kids
wouldn’t come near me—’fraid of touchin’ me, I
guess. And some’d <i>try</i> to touch me—for luck,
y’know. It’s always been like that—and I get awful
lonesome. But some day when I’m grown up I’m going
to save money and go away. Out in the big cities there
are lots of people that are different—all kinds of
shapes and colors and everything and they are too
busy to stop to pity you. Mr. Dugald says so. I’m
goin’ to study and learn to be a doctor. Not the kind
that goes around to see folks like Dr. Blackwell but
the kind that works in a big laboratory and finds out
what cures the sick people. They are just as important
Mr. Dugald says. And no one will <i>see</i> me
then—they’ll just <i>know</i> about me. I don’t care how old
I am, I’m going to do it some time.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Before the sudden fire in his voice Sidney’s heart
quickened with excitement. Why, Lavender was
revealing to her his innermost soul and it was fine
and straight, just as Mr. Dugald had said.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Lavender, you’re <i>wonderful</i>!” she cried,
her eyes shining. “It must be grand to know just
what you want to do and I hope you <i>won’t</i> have to
wait until you’re very old. I’m glad you told me.
Only, only—” a doubt assailed her. “Won’t you
<i>have</i> to go to school?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Lavender flushed. “Sometime, I s’pose. But
not here. Mr. Dugald understands how it is and
he’s helped me. And he says I know more than the
other fellows in the grade I’d be in if I had kept on
going. He sends me books all winter long and Miss
Letty hears me and she got some examination papers
from the teachers at school and I tried them and gee,
they were a cinch. Only don’t tell anyone—Mart,
anyway,” he admonished, in sudden alarm. “It’s
a secret between me and Mr. Dugald and Miss Letty.
Let ’em think I’m a loafer.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The sullen look that had made Lavender’s face
so ugly disappeared under Sidney’s understanding.
And she in turn forgot her own sorrow in her joy
of Lavender’s confidences. Now the golden sun
and the dancing water gladdened her and lifted her
spirit; all <i>was</i> well in the world.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I won’t tell a soul—<i>not</i> a soul, Lav. Oh—”
gasping, “is that what you and Mr. Dugald do when
you go off like you did yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Lavender nodded with a sheepish grin. “Yep,
that’s our school.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, what <i>fun</i>! To study like that. <i>I’d</i> learn
a lot, too. Mart and I were dreadfully curious and
Mart said she knew that Mr. Dugald was painting
you and didn’t want to do it where anyone might
see you on account of—” Poor Sidney stopped,
abruptly in sorry confusion.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, that’s all right! I don’t care what <i>you</i> say
because you don’t feel sorry for me. That’s why
I like to have you ’round. <i>You</i> think I can do something.
Sidney, Mr. Dugald says there was a man
who was an electrical wizard and knew everything
and what he didn’t know he worked over until he
found out and he—he—was—like me—only worse.
I’ll work—gee, how I’ll work—if I get a chance—”
Lavender clenched his long fingers together and his
dark eyes glared fiercely. “I’d cut and run now from
here—if it wasn’t for Aunt Achsa.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, yes,—Aunt Achsa.” That brought Sidney
sharply back to her own troubles.</p>

<p class='c008' >“She’s been awful good to me and I can’t leave
her now even though I don’t do much. Mr. Dugald
says that just now my job’s right here and I must
show folks that my back can carry its job even
if it is—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Don’t</i>, Lav—” cried Sidney, near to the pity
that Lavender despised, but he was too engrossed
in his own feelings to notice it.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Of course you can’t leave Aunt Achsa. Lav,
I feel so cheap and—and—horrid. I was very rude
to Aunt Achsa yesterday and hurt her feelings which
was ungrateful of me after her letting me come and
doing everything here to make me happy. It was
about my hair. I—I—oh, I won’t even <i>repeat</i> what
I said—it was so silly. And <i>that’s</i> really why I
must go home. Trude didn’t exactly tell me I had
to go—she just said perhaps I ought to go and
that I must decide. But of course I know now—after
yesterday—Aunt Achsa would not want me
to stay—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, is <i>that</i> all! As though Aunt Achsa is holding
anything against you! Why, she’s the most forgivingest
person you ever heard of. She wants
to forgive anyone before they’ve done anything. She’s
like that. I’ll bet the next second after you said it
she’d forgotten what you said.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But it’s worse to hurt anyone like that!” cried
Sidney miserably, yet with her heart lifting. For
a thought was taking shape—a reasonable and just
thought.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Lavender—do you think—as long as <i>you</i> like
to have me here—that that would sort of make up
for my rudeness? I mean—can’t I go and ask Aunt
Achsa to let me stay? I’ll tell her how ashamed
I am.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee, you’re square!” exclaimed Lavender,
proudly. “I’ll tell you—we’ll go together and ask
her. I know just what she’ll say but you’ll feel more
honest about it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Lav, you’re wonderful—the way you understand.”
Sidney’s responsive mood leaped out to
the boy’s. Lavender had found something in her
that was above his estimation of girls. And <i>she</i>
had been vouchsafed a glimpse into the heart that
lay beneath the crooked body—with its sensitiveness,
its ambition. “We’re just like pals,” she
finished shyly, “And I’m as proud as can be.” Mentally
she was resolving to live true to Lavender’s
standard. <i>That</i> would be much finer than to try
to be like Mart. In her effort to attain Mart’s showy
independence she had—almost—come to grief, not
quite. Lavender seemed certain that Aunt Achsa
would want her to stay. And he had said he would
go with her while she apologized which would make
it as easy as could be.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Let’s go now!” she said aloud, unmindful of
the fact that Lavender could not possibly be following
her high flight of thought.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Where?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Home—to Aunt Achsa.” Sidney said it very
simply. And to her it seemed like home, now.
With a warm feeling in her heart she thought of
herself as truly belonging to them all and to Sunset
Lane and the homely cottage.</p>

<p class='c008' >“All right.” With a dexterous motion Lavender
swung his strength into the oars. The dory cut the
shining water. Sidney stared solemnly straight
ahead, going over in her mind just what she would
say to Aunt Achsa.</p>

<p class='c008' >At sight of the two Aunt Achsa paused in one
of her multitudinous tasks. It was not usual for
either the boy or the girl to appear until noontime.
Her first thought was an anxiety that something had
happened. She fluttered out to meet them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“There ain’t anything happened, has there?”
her fond eyes on Lavender.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll say something’s <i>most</i> happened,” the boy
began. “Sidney here thinks she ought to go home
on account of something she said yesterday—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Lav, let me do it,” implored Sidney. “Aunt
Achsa, I—I’m so ashamed of the way I answered
you yesterday about my hair. I ought to have told
you—you had a right—but I guess I wanted to feel
grown up and independent. And I am sorry.”</p>

<p class='c008' >At Sidney’s halting confession Aunt Achsa looked
what Lavender, with his odd coinage of words, had
described as the “most forgivingest person.” She
actually blushed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, law’s sake, child, your Aunt Ascha didn’t
mind—don’t worry your little head over that. I
ain’t forgotten how a girl feels even if it was a
long spell ago that I was fifteen. Old as I am my
tongue gets loose in my head lots of times and runs
away with itself. That’s a way tongues has of doing.
And you worryin’ over it and thinkin’ about going
home! Why, why—it’s <i>nice</i> to have you here. Only
last evening I said it to Mr. Dugald. It’s like you
were one of us—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Do you really mean that, Aunt Achsa? I’m
not company any more or—or—a distant cousin?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not a bit. And now long’s you and Lavender’s
come home in the middle of the morning, which I
will say give me a turn, you can set down on the
step out there and pit these cherries for me!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Cherry pie?” cried Sidney, glad over everything.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Better. I’ll bet pickled cherries!” Lavender
had spied the row of glistening glass jars on the
table. “And they’re licking good.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney took the checkered apron Aunt Achsa
handed her and tied it about her slim person, then
they sat down upon the step in the sunshine and
fell to their task. From the shade of the lilac bush
Nip and Tuck regarded them with their inscrutably
wise eyes. Without doubt Nip and Tuck knew why
Sidney’s voice lifted so gaily as the red juice trickled
down her brown arms.</p>

<p class='c008' >When Mr. Dugald returned for dinner he had
to hear how nearly Sidney had come to going home.
“Why, that’s the worst thing I’ve heard,” he
exclaimed with exaggerated alarm, “Now, you wouldn’t
really go and do that, would you?” His eyes laughed
above the serious twist of his lips; Sidney wondered
if he was remembering that first night of her
coming.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I think we ought to celebrate this crisis through
which we have lived,” he declared. “What say to a
picnic supper over at the backside and a call upon
Captain Nelson. He’ll be expecting us about this
time. If I commandeer Pete Cady’s Ford you can
go, too, Aunt Achsa.”</p>

<p class='c008' >When he was in his rollicking mood Aunt Achsa
could never resist her Mr. Dugald. Though she’d
as soon trust herself in one of “them ar-y-planes”
as in Pete Cady’s Ford, which only went under stress
of many inward convulsions and ear-splitting explosions,
she accepted Mr. Dugald’s invitation and fell
at once to planning the “supper,” though their dinner
was not yet cleared away.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll write a letter and mail it and then stop and
tell Mart. Mart may go, may she not?” Sidney
asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008' >Yes, Mart must go, too. Plainly the occasion
<i>was</i> a momentous one.</p>

<p class='c008' >And to Trude Sidney wrote, hastily, for Lavender
was waiting and there would be time for a swim
on the <i>Arabella</i> before they started off in the Ford.</p>

<p class='c008' >“—Aunt Achsa and Lavender both want me to
stay <i>very</i> much. They like me and I am just one
of the family. I help Aunt Achsa too, in a great many
ways and Lavender and I are like pals—it’s just as
though I had a brother which I never thought would
be any fun but now I know it would be a lot especially
if the brother was a twin. You must not worry
when I do not write often for there is so much to
do that I don’t have a bit of time—”</p>

<p class='c008' >And in her excited state of mind Sidney forgot
to tell Trude about her shorn braids.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />PLOTS AND COUNTERPLOTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Rockman’s Wharf was the center of the fishing
activities of the town. To it, each day, the small
fishermen came in their dories with their day’s catch.
From it motor boats chugged off to the bigger boats
moored in the bay, some schooner was always tied
to the gray piles waiting to be overhauled or to be
chartered for deep sea fishing. There was always
something to watch on Rockman’s, or someone to
talk to. The fishing folk spent their leisure hours
loafing in the shadow of the long shed, smoking and
talking; often the artists boldly pitched their easels
and stools in everyone’s way and painted a gray hull
and a pink-gray sail, checkered with white patches,
or a dark-skinned Portuguese bending to the task of
spiking shiny cod from the bottom of a dory and
throwing them to the wharf to be measured and
weighed.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney never failed to thrill to the changing scenes
that Rockman’s offered. She had become, like Mart
and Lavender and a score of other youngsters, a
familiar figure on the old wharf. With the ease of a
Cape Coder born she talked to the Portuguese fishermen
and to the men who worked in the shed and
to Captain Hawkes, who when he was not on the
<i>Mabel T</i> sat on a leaning pile smoking and waiting
for tourists to engage him. She knew the fishermen
and their boats by name and was as interested in how
much old Amos Martin got for his beautiful catch
as Amos himself. Rockman’s knew her as “that
summer gal of Achsa Green’s.” “She beats all
for askin’ questions,” it agreed, smilingly. “Ain’t
anything misses <i>that</i> gal!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney certainly did not intend anything should.
She had to make up for all the years she had not
lived in Provincetown and if she watched and listened
closely she might some day catch up with Mart and
Lavender. She sat on the wharf late one afternoon,
dangling her bare legs over its edge, and watched
the sails and the circling seagulls and everything
within sight and waited for Mart and Lavender to
join her as they had agreed. Lavender was running
an errand for Cap’n Hawkes and Mart had gone
to Commercial Street for some candy.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was too early in the day for the fishermen to
come in. Sidney knew that. For that reason a dory
approaching Rockman’s caught her eye. In it were
two men, in oilskins and rubber boots. As it came
near to the wharf a thickset fellow stepped out from
the shed. Sidney had never noticed him before.
And her eyes grew round as she observed that in place
of one hand he wore an iron hook. Like a flash
there came to her a confused memory of stories she
had read of high piracy and buccaneers. She looked
at the ugly hook and at the man and then at the
approaching dory and every pulse quickened and
tingled. Without moving a muscle she leapt to
attention.</p>

<p class='c008' >Partly concealed as she was by the pile of old
canvas the man did not see her. Nor did the two
in the dory notice her. As the dory bumped its nose
against the wharf one of the men threw a line to the
man on the dock who caught it dexterously with the
iron hook. He had evidently been waiting for the
dory. Then one of the two in the boat sprang to
the wharf while the other busied himself in shutting
off the engine.</p>

<p class='c008' >“’Lo, Jed. Good catch?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yep. Good catch.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Not unusual words for Rockman’s wharf but they
rang with strange significance to Sidney, athirst for
adventure. Why, there were not any fish in the
dory! And the man with the hook had called the
other Jed! Jed Starrow! <i>It was Jed Starrow.</i>
She peeked cautiously around the old sails. Jed
Starrow was tall and very dark and had just the
right swagger. If he had worn a gay ’kerchief
knotted about his head, earrings, and a cutlass in his
sash he would have been the pirate true; as it was
easy for Sidney to see him like that in spite of his
commonplace oilskins and his cap.</p>

<p class='c008' >The two men walked slowly up the wharf, Jed
Starrow a little in advance of the other. The man in
the dory, having shut off the engine, lounged in the
bow of the boat and lighted a pipe.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney sat very still until Jed Starrow and his
companion were out of sight. Then she climbed to
her feet, slipped along the side of the shed and ran
up the wharf until she could jump down on the beach.
Here she waited Mart’s return.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mart and Lavender came almost at the same
moment, Mart with a bulging bag of assorted and
dreadful-hued candies. Mysteriously Sidney beckoned
to them to join her in the seclusion of the beach.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Whatever’s happened?” mumbled Mart her
mouth full of candy. “You act like you were struck
silly.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ve found something out!” Sidney spoke in
a sepulchral whisper though their voices could not
have been heard by anyone on the wharf. “Lav,
<i>who is Jed Starrow</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Lav stared at her in wonder.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why—why—he’s Jed Starrow. That’s all.
Fellow ’round town. Owns the <i>Puritan</i>, that new
schooner.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I believe—” Sidney spoke slowly. “I believe
Jed Starrow is a—pirate!”</p>

<p class='c008' >At this Lav and Mart broke into loud laughter.
But Sidney stood her ground, not even flushing under
their derision.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You can laugh. But I know—I know—instinctively.
I sometimes do know things like that. I
guess it’s an occult power I have. And, anyway,
Cap’n Davies hinted as much.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Cap’n Davies—he’s always snoopin’ round
for trouble. We have plenty of rum-runners and I
guess lots of things get smuggled—but <i>pirates</i>—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Captain Davies distinctly <i>said</i> pirates—” insisted
Sidney who had not sufficient experience to
properly classify rum-runners and smugglers. Anyway,
pirates sounded more exciting.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s started all this?” asked Lavender.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney told of the landing of the dory and the
man with the iron hook for a hand.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, that’s only Joe Josephs. He’s a wrecker.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Mart was catching something of Sidney’s spirit;
in truth Mart was unconsciously catching a great
deal from Sidney these days.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, he’s certainly doing something <i>besides</i>
wrecking. It’s been an awful poor season for wrecks
and gran’ma says Joe Josephs’ wife’s been to her
sister’s at Plymouth and got a new coat and hat for
the trip and she hasn’t had a new thing since Letty
Vine give her her blue serge dress and that
wasn’t new.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You see—” cried Sidney, exulting, “Joe Josephs
has divided the spoils!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, you girls are crazy! Why everyone in the
town knows Jed Starrow. Don’t you think everyone
’ud know if he was a pirate? He’s lived here ever
since he was born, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But, Lav, it was so <i>funny</i> for them to say just
alike ‘good catch’ when they didn’t have any fish
at all! It was a password. Pirates always have
passwords.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Prob’bly a code,” jeered Lav, rocking with
laughter. “You watch the sky anights; mebbe they
use rockets to signal one another, too.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney was still sufficiently stirred by the whole
incident as to be able to tolerate Lav’s stupidity.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Of course I know pirates—even these days—wouldn’t
use rockets and codes. I’m not as ignorant
as all <i>that</i>. And I <i>am</i> going to watch, day and night.
It’ll be easy for me to watch ’cause I’m a girl and no
one will suspect what’s in my head.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I should say they wouldn’t! Gee!” and Lav
permitted himself a last long laugh.</p>

<p class='c008' >“And you may change your tune yet,” cried
Sidney, really vexed, “When Mart and I discover
something.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’ll both keep our eyes open!” Mart agreed,
admiring Sidney’s imagination even though she could
not always follow it. “But we ought to keep quiet
’bout our suspicions, hadn’t we?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney hesitated. She <i>did</i> want to tell Mr. Dugald
about the “good catch.” But Mart went on convincingly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If we told anyone we were on, y’see it might
get to Jed Starrow himself.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’d be the biggest joke in town,” Lav
warned, with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney ignored him. “Of course we must not
breathe a word of our suspicions to a soul,” she
averred. “And if either of us finds out anything she
must tell the other at once. I think we <i>will</i> find
something, too, for two heads are better than one.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Say, are you going to leave me out of your
fun—just ’cause I laughed?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney did not want to leave Lavender out but she
did want to punish him a little. She pretended to
consider his question.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If you find it all so highly amusing you might
be tempted to tell someone—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’ya mean? That I’d squeal on you? If
you think <i>that</i>, well, I don’t want to be in on it—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Lav, of course I know you wouldn’t
squeal,” cried Sidney, relenting. “And we <i>will</i> need
you to help find things out. Oughtn’t we to have
some sign or a word or something to sort of signal
that one of us knows something to tell the others?
What’ll it be—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Mart scowled down at the sand. For the moment
she was possessed with an envy for Sidney’s agile
imagination, a disgust at her own stolid faculties.
Why couldn’t <i>she</i> think of things right offhand the
way Sidney could?</p>

<p class='c008' >But it was Lavender who suggested the “signal.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hook!” he offered and Sidney clapped her
hands in delight.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, grand! No one would ever guess. And
it sounds so shivery! Why, that man with the iron
hook just <i>has</i> to be a pirate!” Then she suddenly
grew embarrassed by her own enthusiasm. “It’s
different with you two,” she explained, “you’ve
lived here all your lives and you don’t know what
it’s like to have to be a po—” She broke off, startled.
One breath more and she would have revealed
the truth to Lavender and Mart. “Middletown is
the pokiest town—there’s nothing exciting ever happens
there.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t know as much exciting happens here.
I s’pose enough happens, only you have to have something
inside you that makes you <i>think</i> it exciting,
I guess.” Which was Mart’s initial step into any
analysis of emotion, but not her last.</p>

<p class='c008' >Lavender turned toward the wharf. “I got
to go and hunt up Cap’n Hawkes,” he announced
regretfully. “So it’ll be ‘hook,’ will it? Well, I
swear from henceforth I’ll watch every citizen of
Provincetown to see if he has a cutlass at his belt or
a tattoo on his chest. Come on, girls—sleuths,
I mean—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I do hope,” sighed Sidney as she and Mart
wandered homeward over the hard sand, “that one
of us’ll have to say ‘hook’ soon. Don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008' >But in her heart Sidney had an annoying
conviction that neither Mart nor Lav took her pirate
suspicions quite as seriously as she did. At supper
Lav deliberately kept the conversation on Jed Starrow
and his activities with a disconcerting twinkle in his
eyes. Mart assumed the same lofty tolerance of
their secret game as she showed to their play on the
<i>Arabella</i>—as though it were a sort of second-best
fun.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, I don’t care,” Sidney declared stoutly.
To think of Jed Starrow as a wicked buccaneer and
Joe Josephs, the wrecker, as his accomplice in piracy,
satisfied her craving for adventure. For the next
many days she let it color everything she saw, every
word she overheard; the connecting links she forged
from her own active imagination.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />WORDS THAT SING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >To seal their pact of palship Lavender took Sidney
to Top Notch.</p>

<p class='c008' >He led her over a little path that wound around
the smaller sand dunes directly behind Sunset Lane
until they came to a clump of old willows. Once
a cottage had stood under the willows; its timbers
and crumbling bricks still lay about half buried in
the sand and covered over with moss and climbing
weeds. Though not a quarter of a mile from Aunt
Achsa’s the spot offered as complete solitude as
though it had been at the ends of the world. The
only sounds that reached its quiet were the far-off
screaming of the seagulls as they fought for their
food at low tide, and the distant boom-boom of the
surging sea on the beach of the backside.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Look up there!” commanded Lavender proudly.
And Sidney, looking as he had bidden her, gave a
little cry of delight. For there among the great
limbs of the biggest of the willows was a tiny house.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s mine. Top Notch. Mr. Dugald built
it. That’s where I study.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, it’s the cutest thing I ever <i>saw</i>!” Sidney
was already at the bottom of the narrow ladder that
led to the house. “Can I go up? I feel just like
Alice in Wonderland, as though I’d have to take a
pill to get small enough to squeeze in.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, no, you won’t. It’s big enough for two.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The structure had been cleverly contrived; plankings
securely nailed to the spreading branches gave
indeed ample space for two and even more; there
were comfortable seats and wide unshuttered windows,
a rough table and a secret shelf that looked
like part of the wall until one unlocked and let down
a little door and revealed a neat row of books. A
“wing” of the house, added to another branch, Sidney
declared, was “upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney sat down on one of the seats and Lavender
sat on the other.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, this is the best <i>yet</i>!” Sidney cried with
a long breath. “I don’t see how Mr. Dugald thinks
of the nice things he does.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’s the best sort that ever lived.” Lavender
asserted with a little break in his voice. “I don’t
know why he bothers ’bout me. But he found out
that I came over here and sort o’ camped among those
ruins down there and I used to hide my things in
that old oven so’s Aunt Achsa wouldn’t find them.
He knew why, too. Y’see it bothers Aunt Achsa
a lot to have me want to read and study so much—she’s
afraid I’ll get to thinkin’ of going away. She
don’t know, y’see, that I <i>am</i> going, some day. So
then Mr. Dugald helped me build Top Notch. There
are all my books.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney ran her eye over the different volumes;
among them were stories of seafaring adventure and
books on travel and science, a dictionary, a Bible—and
a volume of Browning’s poetry. Sidney’s hand
shot out toward this last, then quickly dropped to
her side.</p>

<p class='c008' >Lavender saw the gesture. “I like poetry,”
he explained shyly. “I’m kinda afraid of it—I mean
I don’t understand it and I wish I did. Mr. Dugald
says he don’t, either. But there’s something about
the way poetry goes that’s like music—it makes a
sound. It’s like the ocean, moving and beating, and
kind o’ like your heart. And sometimes the words
hurt, they’re so beautiful. I wish I knew more about
poetry.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney felt shivery cold all over and hot at the
same moment. She kept her eyes on the square that
was the open window. She knew she ought to tell
the truth to Lavender—right now. But, oh, she
<i>couldn’t</i>. Yet she must! She had almost summoned
the right words to begin when Lavender rose
and stepped toward the ladder.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I brought you here so’s you’d know ’bout it
and use it when you want to—the books’n everythin’.
Only don’t let Mart come. She’d make fun of it.
Here’s where I hide the key to the shelf. S’long.
I got to get down to Rockman’s.” Lavender abruptly
slipped down the ladder and ran out of sight among
the dunes.</p>

<p class='c008' >Left alone in the Top Notch Sidney felt a guilty
remorse sweep over her. Lavender had shared with
her his sanctum sanctorum, he had admitted his love
of poetry and she had sat silent and had not told
him the truth.</p>

<p class='c008' >Like music—like the waves of the ocean beating—like
one’s heart—words that hurt, his shy
sentences rang in her ears. Probably he had found
it hard to tell her for fear she might laugh. Laugh—why,
suddenly she knew that that was really
the way poetry seemed to her! She just <i>made</i> herself
believe she hated it when she did not hate it at
all. Music—she could hear Isolde’s soft drawling
voice reading from one of father’s books and it was
indeed music. She had all that treasure that she
could share with Lavender, hungry for the beautiful,
and yet she had sat mum. Oh, she had been horrid,
stingy. And he was sharing Top Notch with her.</p>

<p class='c008' >Quite naturally Sidney, brooding secretly over
her shortcomings, fell back upon the long-neglected
“Dorothea.” And she took “Dorothea” at once
to Top Notch, the better to pour out her feelings
undisturbed. She covered a whole page with her
appreciation of Lavender’s confidence and her utter
unworthiness of such tribute. Then the fascination
of Top Notch brought her to Mr. Dugald.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I wish the girls knew him. He’s so much nicer
than any of their suitors, than even any of Vick’s.”
Let it be recorded here that Sidney paused and chewed
her pencil and pondered the difficulties of bringing
about an acquaintance between Mr. Dugald and any
one of her three sisters. Romance was never far
from Sidney’s imaginings; she invariably endowed
every young man who came to the Romley house
for any sort of a reason with deep purposes of wooing.
But this situation offered obstacles to even
Sidney’s imagination for miles separated Mr. Dugald
from the charms of her sisters; there seemed no way
in which he could meet them.</p>

<p class='c008' >However, obstacles only stimulated Sidney. “I
know,” she wrote furiously, “I’ll pick out one of
them and talk about her all the time and wish and wish
in my heart and just <i>make</i> something happen. Now,
which one, dear Dorothea, is the important thing for
me to decide.”</p>

<p class='c008' >From point of romance Vick offered the most
possibilities—there was so much about Vick to talk
about. But Mr. Dugald did not seem Vick’s sort.
Vick liked what she called “smooth” men and Mr.
Dugald was most certainly not that. And, anyway,
Vick would simply have to have a rich man to give
her all the things she said she intended having and
Mr. Dugald was not rich or he’d have more fashionable
clothes. No, Vick was out of it. Isolde—well,
he wasn’t Issy’s sort, either. Sidney did not
know just what Issy’s sort was like but she did not
think it was like Mr. Dugald. Anyway, she did not
<i>want</i> Issy to have him. She wanted Trude to have
him, dear old peachy Trude who had never had any
beau except her Lost Love.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I shall talk about dear Trude and all her nice
points. I shall even say she is beautiful for she is
in the eyes of love and I like to talk about Trude,
anyway. So from this day forth I shall gather the
threads of Destiny into my white hands and weave
a beautiful pattern of love and happiness.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Forthwith Sidney began her weaving and found
it amazingly easy. She talked through supper about
Trude and took it as a promising sign that Mr.
Dugald himself asked her all sorts of questions as
though he “thirsted” to know more. And Sidney
answered generously. She walked with him after
supper to the postoffice in order to talk more about
Trude. The next day she produced a very unflattering
snapshot of Trude and left it on the kitchen
table and later gloated in secret over its disappearance,
though of course Aunt Achsa <i>might</i> have burned it
up in her tireless cleaning and straightening.</p>

<p class='c008' >After that Trude’s name crossed the conversation
of the little family frequently and quite naturally.
Mr. Dugald called her “Truda” and knew that she
was staying with the Whites on Long Island and
that she was the prop of the entire Romley family
and never thought of herself at all and that she
wasn’t as pretty as Vick or Isolde but really, <i>nicer</i>—Sidney
quite opened her heart. And then one morning
when she was helping Mr. Dugald clean his
brushes she told him of Trude’s Lost Love. Not
much about it for the reason that she herself knew
only a little and also because a strange look went
suddenly over Mr. Dugald’s face.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Put on the brakes, little sister. Aren’t you letting
me into secrets that perhaps your Trude would
not want me to know?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney’s face flamed. She knew Mr. Dugald
was right. “Oh, I <i>should</i> not have told you. I—just
got started and didn’t think. Can’t you forget
what I said as though I didn’t say it?” she pleaded.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll forget what you said,” Mr. Dugald promised,
knowing perfectly well that he could not and
from that day on he never asked any more questions
of Sidney concerning her family.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m not playing fair,” he said to himself but
not to her.</p>

<p class='c008' >To “Dorothea” Sidney confided her chagrin.
“I didn’t say <i>much</i>—just that Trude had had one
heartbreaking affair with a man she met at Mrs.
White’s and that I didn’t believe she’d gotten over
it yet. I read a book once where it said pity was
akin to love and I thought if Mr. Dugald <i>knew</i> that
Trude’s heart was broken he would feel very sorry
for her. But he looked so embarrassed that I knew
I had not been maidenly as Isolde would say and I
blushed furiously. He promised to forget it and I
think he will. But, oh, perhaps I have defeated
my dear purpose for now when I speak of Trude he
looks funny as though he was afraid of what I was
going to say next. I am in despair.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The sound of voices, one unmistakably Mr.
Dugald’s, disturbed Sidney’s musings. She thrust
“Dorothea” into the secret shelf and locked it. Then
she peeped out of the window.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mr. Dugald and Miss Letty Vine approached
down the narrow path of hard sand straight toward
the willows. Sidney’s first impulse was to call to
them; in the next moment she realized that they had
no intention of climbing to Top Notch. Miss Vine
wore heavy gloves on her hands and carried a trowel
and a basket and was making little jumps here and
there among the weeds in search of “specimens.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney sat very still and watched her. She thought
Miss Letty the most interesting person, anyway.
She always looked like the figurehead of a ship come
to life, as Mr. Dugald had described her. She was
very tall and bony, with huge bones that made lumps
in her shoulders and elbows and even at her knees;
her temples protruded and her cheek-bones and her
jaw. She had long fingers with prominent knuckles.</p>

<p class='c008' >Miss Letty always wore a style of dress that she
had evolved for herself long ago and that was plainly
built for comfort rather than style or beauty. She held
any grace of trimming as “froppery” and scorned
it, going always unadorned. She wore her “learning”
just as she wore her clothes. That she had
gone to school in Boston and studied music there no
one would ever know from anything she said. One
just thought of Miss Letty as being <i>born</i> with knowledge,
the way she was born capable. “Capable from
the cradle,” Aunt Achsa sometimes said.</p>

<p class='c008' >Everyone liked Miss Letty in spite of the bones
and the sharp tongue and the freakish dresses, and no
one knew exactly why; it might have been her eyes
which were kindly and had little twinkles deep-set
within their irises, or her way of knowing the thing
to do and going ahead and doing it. Everyone
respected Miss Letty and acknowledged her worth
at once.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now Mr. Dugald was lounging against one of
the rotting timbers of the house-that-had-been and
sketching Miss Letty on the pad which he always
carried in the pocket of his old coat. <i>He</i> thought
Miss Letty most interesting, too. He spent considerable
time at her house and often took long walks
with her.</p>

<p class='c008' >While Sidney watched, Miss Letty sat down
stiffly by Mr. Dugald’s side and looked with interest
at the sketch.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s about the thousandth one you’ve made,
isn’t it? And you can’t seem to get any of them
bad enough.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I can’t get into it what I want,” Dugald Allan
laughed, tearing off the sheet and crumpling it in
his hand. “You see I feel something about you
that I haven’t been able yet to put on canvas. But
I will some day. Then I’ll know I have gotten
somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Miss Letty considered his words as though they
were of some one quite apart from herself.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I suppose it’s my soul you’re hoping to catch.
Well, I never did wear it on my sleeve,” and she
laughed, a great laugh like a man’s.</p>

<p class='c008' >“No, you do not. That’s true. But it’s my
job to get at people’s souls, wherever they wear ’em,
and paint them in.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, hunt, then. Souls are queer things,”
opined Miss Letty, carefully drawing off her old
gloves and smoothing them out with her long, bony
fingers. “I sometimes think the Lord gets the souls
mixed up and puts them in the wrong bodies. Maybe
that’s wicked but if ’tis I think lots wickeder things.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Maybe He knows more about it than we think
He does—” said Dugald so softly that Sidney, frankly
eavesdropping, had hard work to catch the words.
They were so interesting, these two, that she was
glad she had not let them know she was in Top Notch;
she hoped they would talk a long time about souls
and such things. But without warning Miss Letty
changed the subject.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Did you ever know such a smart piece as that
girl of Achsy Green’s?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sidney?” And Mr. Dugald chuckled. “She’s
sure one rare kid. I don’t know when I’ve enjoyed
anything as much as having her around. And do you
know the youngster’s rarely gifted—she has a colorful
imagination and a perception of verities that
may take her further than her father. She is fighting
destiny just now, but it will get her; if she isn’t a
poet she’ll be a creator of something equally fine.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m too old to live to know—but you will,” answered
Miss Letty, quite calmly. “And maybe we’re
both wrong. Maybe her finest work will be to raise
a family. And I don’t know, when all’s said and done,
but that’s as good a job as your daubs or my music or
a book of verse. You’ve got something then that
can love you back.”</p>

<p class='c008' >But Sidney did not hear this simple philosophy
for she had dropped to the floor of Top Notch and
covered her ears with her hands. Her face flamed
with the anger that held her. How <i>dared</i> they sit
there and talk her over! And say that she was going
to write poetry! That she had something or other
and might be greater than her father! A poet! Well,
she <i>wouldn’t</i>! <i>She would not!</i> She thought, with
stinging humiliation, of the verses she had written
in her attic den and that lay now hidden in the secret
place under the floor. She’d written them just because
they hummed so in her ears that she had <i>had</i>
to write them, but when she returned home she’d tear
them into tiny bits and never, <i>never</i> write another
line, even though the words did jingle and hum.</p>

<p class='c008' >She sat cramped on the floor of Top Notch, until
she was certain the intruders had gone away. Then
she got stiffly to her feet and reached for “Dorothea.”
Hot tears of mortification blinded her eyes so that
she had to dash them away with the back of her hand.
One splashed upon the page she had opened.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I have come, dear Dorothea, to another crossroad
in life. You only shall witness my solemn vow.
<i>I shall not be a poet!</i> I shall be a missionary. A
missionary’s life is fraught with danger and takes
them to distant climes and they have to dress in what
is given to them out of a barrel—”</p>

<p class='c008' >She felt a little better and pleasantly sacrificial
after she had written this vow. Poor Sidney, she did
not know that the words that Lavender had likened
to music and the beating sea would sing in her ears
as persistently in Timbuctoo as in the quiet of her
attic den!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c006'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />CAP’N PHIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >What made life at Sunset Lane so delightful
to Sidney was that she never knew from one day
to the next what she was going to do. Back at
Middletown everything was always arranged ahead—they
did this on Tuesday and this on Wednesday
and always on Saturday there was the League. At
Sunset Lane she did not even know when it was
Tuesday or Thursday unless she stopped to think;
jolly things happened as though they popped out of
the blue ether.</p>

<p class='c008' >Like that Miss Letty dropped in one evening after
supper.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Do you want to ride over to Wellfleet with
me enough to be ready at six o’clock?” she asked
Sidney very casually, as though it were nothing at
all to suggest. Sidney had longed to ride with Miss
Letty in the sideboard buggy behind King who,
Mr. Dugald declared, had come off the Ark with
Noah. And to go to Wellfleet, perhaps see her friend
Cap’n Phin Davies!</p>

<p class='c008' >“Can we call on Cap’n Davies?” she asked
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008' >Miss Letty smiled. “I reckon I couldn’t steer
King away from Elizy Davies’ house. I thought I’d
take you there and leave you while I give my lessons
and then I’d ride ’round and have a visit with Elizy
and Phin and maybe some of Elizy’s gingerbread.
Elizy and I went to school together.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The next morning Sidney was ready and on her,
way to Miss Letty’s house before six o’clock. She
had been far too excited to eat any of the breakfast
Aunt Achsa had set out for her but Miss Letty, guessing
this, made her sit down and eat a bit of toast and
a boiled egg.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s a long way between here and Wellfleet and
King’s slower than he used to be.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Seated next to Miss Letty, jogging along through
the misty morning, Sidney could not speak for pure
rapture of delight. She had never ridden behind a
horse in her life! She thought King a giant steed;
with every swish of his long tail her heart skipped
a beat, the move of his great muscles under his heavy
flanks held her fascinated gaze. Miss Letty talked
to him as though he were human and the animal
understood and tossed his head. She said: “Now,
King, we’re going to Wellfleet and we got to get there
before noon.” And then she let the reins slacken
and slip down between her knees as though she had
no further care. One certainly could not do that with
an automobile! Sidney did not wonder now that
Miss Letty preferred King to a Ford.</p>

<p class='c008' >She wished she dared ask Miss Letty how old
King really was but she did not think it polite
anymore than if she asked Miss Letty how old she was.
King was not handsome, he was bony like his mistress,
but he certainly understood everything. Miss
Letty said he knew they were going to Elizy Davies’
by the way he loped ahead; King, too, had a strong
liking for Elizy Davies’ gingerbread.</p>

<p class='c008' >“She feeds it to him in great hunks. And he
won’t eat anyone else’s gingerbread, either. Scornful
as you please even when I offer him some. Now
I say that’s discriminating for a horse. I suppose
it’s what folks call horse-sense.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney did not know which she liked better, watching
the gleaming marshes through which the highway
wound or listening to Miss Letty’s spasmodic conversation.
Miss Letty pointed out old landmarks to
Sidney, then told her something of the school at
Truro to which she and Elizy Davies had gone, then
of the little girls to whom she was about to give music
lessons. She had taught their mothers. Then she
lapsed into a deep silence broken only by an occasional
“cl-lk” to King which she made with her tongue
against her teeth and to which King paid no attention
except for a flick of his right ear.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney, looking down at the great bony hands
limply holding the reins, thought it very funny to
picture them on the keyboard of a piano. If she had
spoken her thoughts aloud Miss Letty would have
told her, quite calmly, that she couldn’t play a note
now, but that she knew when notes were played right
and she could still rap lagging fingers smartly across
the knuckles. Folks would have her, anyway. Sidney
did not know, of course, that Miss Letty was a tradition
and that Cape Cod clings to its traditions.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You’ll think Phin Davies’ house the queerest
thing you ever saw. It isn’t a house nor is it a boat;
it’s as much one as t’other and not anything, I’d say,
but what two crazy men getting their heads together
rigged up. Cap’n Davies said as long as he had to
live ashore he wanted his house to look like a boat,
he didn’t care what folks said, and he hunted the Cape
over to find a builder who wouldn’t apply to have
him locked up in an asylum, straight off. He got a
man from Falmouth, who’d been a master once on
a trader and sort of knew how Phin Davies felt. But
there was Elizy carrying on awful about it and saying
<i>she’d</i> always looked forward to the time when she
could have a nice house—and there the two of them
were. And the house is as ’tis. Phin has the front
of it that’s as like the bow of a ship without any
rigging as they could make it, and Elizy has the
back that’s got as up-to-date a kitchen as any on
Cape Cod.”</p>

<p class='c008' >A winding road, all sweet with wild primroses
led up to the queer house on the eminence. Sure
enough, there was the front part like the forward hull
of a ship, deck-houses and all; and the back like any
sensible New England home. Sidney giggled
delightedly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But there aren’t two finer people on this Cape!”
declared Miss Letty. “And there’s Phin coming
to meet us. Reckon he spied King through his glasses
along beyond Wellfleet.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Cap’n Phin Davies was overjoyed to see Sidney.
“Why, it’s the little gal I found on the train!” he
repeated over and over. “Elizy,” he called lustily
toward the kitchen door, “come and see! It’s the
little gal I told you ’bout that I found on the train.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Elizy Davies came hurrying from the kitchen
door. She was lean to gauntness and tall and wore
round, steel-rimmed glasses low on the sharp bridge
of her nose. Sidney immediately understood how
she had been able to hold out for her half of the
house. But she greeted Sidney with kindly interest
and Miss Letty with real affection.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I thought you’d be over this way today. Anne
Matthews said Maida was going to have a lesson.
Got my gingerbread all mixed.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Miss Letty had not gotten out of the buggy. She
turned King’s head.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Thought I’d leave Sidney here while I gave my
lessons,” she explained briefly and then clucked to
King.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mrs. Davies took Sidney into her part of the
house. It was cool and dark and sweet-smelling and
very, very neat. Sidney sat down in a stiff rocker
and answered Mrs. Davies’ questions concerning
her Aunt Achsa and Lavender, while Cap’n Davies
stumped restlessly about.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Now I cal’late you’ve heard enough, Elizy,
and I’m goin’ to carry my little shipmate off and
show her <i>my</i> part o’ the old hull.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Elizy accepted his suggestion with a smile and
admitted that she had to finish up her work.
Immensely relieved Sidney followed Cap’n Davies.
With the enthusiasm of a boy he took her to the
front rooms of the house and showed her his treasured
possessions. There was not a corner of the
globe that had not contributed something to his collection
of mementoes. And each meant to the old seafarer,
not its own intrinsic value, but a certain voyage.
“I got that when we took a cargo to Shanghai.
Roughest v’yage I ever ran into,” and “I picked
that up when we had to lay to at Buenos Aires ’cause
every man jack in the fo’castle had small-pox,” or
“found that when Elizy shipped with me on the old
<i>Amanda L. Downs</i>. Forget just where—” and so on.</p>

<p class='c008' >In the cupola on the roof that Cap’n Davies called
his lookout and where he spent most of his time, he
had put the paraphernalia from the <i>Viking</i>, his last
boat. He had rigged up a bunk so that he could
even sleep there when he fancied. He explained
that he never let Elizy “tidy up.” “When I get a
notion I fix things shipshape myself, but I ain’t had
a notion now in sometime.” Sidney could see that.
Yet the littered room had an individuality that Elizy’s
own spotless quarters lacked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Now set down on that bunk and let me have a
look at you,” the Cap’n commanded, seating himself
in an old swivel chair that creaked and trembled under
his weight. “’Pears to me you’ve picked up quite
a bit!” He smiled his approval and nodded his great
head. “Yes, they ain’t starvin’ you and I’d say you’d
been runnin’ in the sun and there ain’t anything
that can beat our Cape sun for bringin’ out roses on
bushes and little gal’s cheeks.” He beamed with
satisfaction over his long speech. “Now, tell me,
how’s the pirates? Seen any?”</p>

<p class='c008' >His question came so suddenly that Sidney
started. She hesitated, then answered slowly. “Yes,
I have.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, I’ll be dumblasted!” exclaimed the captain,
plainly astonished by her answer. He had
spoken only in pleasant chaff and had not thought
Sidney would take him seriously.</p>

<p class='c008' >“At least—” Sidney amended, “I <i>think</i> I’ve seen
some. I told Lavender and Mart they’re pirates
or—or something, and we’re going to watch every
move Jed Starrow makes, at least every chance we
get—”</p>

<p class='c008' >The jovial expression suddenly left the Captain’s
genial face and a heavy frown furrowed the leathery
forehead.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Jed Starrow! Now what in thunder would
make you set on Jed Starrow—”</p>

<p class='c008' >His frown alarmed Sidney. Perhaps she had
made a dreadful mistake in divulging their suspicions
of Jed Starrow, suspicions which really Lavender
and Mart did not share, except as it helped their fun
along—</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, I shouldn’t have said that it’s Jed Starrow
we suspect. I heard Mr. Starrow and that—that
man with the hook—say something that sounded
mysterious and I told the others, Mart and Lav, about
it and we’re just pretending that we <i>think</i> they’re
pirates! It’s something to do and makes it exciting
when we’re down on the wharves. And they <i>do</i>
look like pirates—especially the wrecker man. But
I ought not to have said their names—as long as it’s
only a sort of game we’re playing, ought I? You
won’t tell anyone, will you?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Cap’n Davies promised hastily and took Sidney
off to see the new heifer calf, just a week old. In
the delight of fondling the pretty little creature
Sidney forgot her embarrassing break. She did not
notice that the Captain seemed deeply absorbed by
some thought and that when he was not talking he
still frowned.</p>

<p class='c008' >After she had visited the Cove and watched the
waves dash against the Head and explored the boathouse
Miss Letty arrived with King and Mrs. Davies
summoned them to dinner. They ate dinner in the
big kitchen that stretched from one side of the house
to the other so that a breeze, all tangy with salt,
stirred the heat of the room. Mrs. Elizy and Miss
Letty talked and Sidney ate and laughed as Cap’n
Phin surreptitiously, and with sly winks at her, fed
the old Maltese cat under the table. There were fried
chicken and peas and mashed potatoes and the gingerbread
and cocoa and flaky cherry pie. And after
dinner they all went out to watch King eat the gingerbread
of his choice.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney and Miss Letty helped Mrs. Elizy clear
up and then they joined Cap’n Phin under the shade
of the trees on the Head from where they could see
far out over the bay. Sidney stretched on the grass
and listened while the others talked, determining to
put down every word they said in “Dorothea” so
that she could read it over when she was a very old
woman. She loved the way Miss Letty answered
back to Cap’n Davies when he teased her and she was
not the least bit afraid of Mrs. Davies, now. All
in all, though it was a very quiet afternoon, it was
one Sidney long remembered.</p>

<p class='c008' >When Miss Letty announced that they’d “have
to be starting for home,” Cap’n Davies recollected
that there was something in the lookout he wanted
to show Sidney and had forgotten. But when they
reached the lookout it appeared that he had forgotten
again for he sat down in the swivel chair and
faced her.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Looky here,” he commanded in a voice Sidney
had not heard before in their brief acquaintance,
“don’t know as it’s any o’ my affair but I want you
to keep off the wharves after dark. Off the beach,
too. Play your games in daylight. Things are
shapin’ to a sort o’ head and there may be mischief
anytime and you’d best be at home come dark. If
you don’t promise me I’ll speak a word to Achsy
Green—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, I’ll promise,” cried Sidney anxiously. A
warning to Aunt Achsa would most likely curtail
their precious freedom. But she could not resist
the temptation of questioning. “What mischief?”
she asked, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008' >Cap’n Davies hesitated. Then he drew a letter
from his pocket and tapped it with his finger.</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s from the Custom House in Boston. Come
last week. They’re sending secret service men down
to comb the Cape. Been huntin’ the hul coast for
a year and a half and they sort o’ suspicion these
parts because a lot of ’em was shipped into Boston
that—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, <i>what</i>! You haven’t said <i>what</i>—” broke
in Sidney, aquiver.</p>

<p class='c008' >“So I didn’t. I’m sailin’ stern first, I cal’late.
Well, there’s always smuggling and smuggling and
I guess there always will be, but when it comes to
<i>diamonds</i> Uncle Sam sets up and takes notice. And
they’re suspicionin’ that they’re comin’ in somewheres
along the Cape, and this part of the Cape, too. And
<i>this</i>—” he shook another sheet in Sidney’s face, “this
is a notice of a reward offered by Wellfleet and Truro
counties for findin’ the dog that’s givin’ this part
of the Cape a bad name! Five thousand dollars. In
two weeks it’ll be stuck on every post hereabouts ’s
far as Provincetown. And Phin Davies ain’t goin’
to lay to ’till I’ve found out whether it’s someone
on the Cape that’s doing it or not. Cape Cod’s brung
up a race of honest men who could sleep with their
doors wide open and if anybody is hurtin’ the good
name of the Cape I want to know it. ’Taint the
money I want.”</p>

<p>CAPTAIN DAVIES DREW A LETTER FROM HIS POCKET AND TAPPED IT WITH HIS FINGER</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >Sidney was scarcely drawing a breath for excitement.
The Captain, suddenly subsiding, observed
her tenseness. He laughed embarrassedly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Now there I go spillin’ everything <i>I</i> know
like a ship that’s sprung a leak. I’ll have to ask you
to keep mum ’bout what I’ve told you, mate, and
remember your word to keep off the beach come night.
Ain’t no place for a gal like you.” And without
another word he rose and led Sidney down the narrow
stairs.</p>

<p class='c008' >On the homeward ride Miss Letty found Sidney
an abstracted companion. After a few attempts to
keep up conversation she subsided into silence herself.
“It’s good to find a young one who can keep
her tongue still a spell and enjoy her own thoughts.”</p>

<p class='c008' >But Sidney was not enjoying her thoughts, not
at all. With the realization that she could not share
with Mart and Lavender the astounding revelations
Cap’n Phin Davies had made all joy in them had
fled. Had not she and Mart and Lavender agreed
solemnly to tell one another anything any one of
them discovered? It would be so perfectly thrilling
to greet them the instant she reached home with
“Hook!” They would be so surprised. They
wouldn’t laugh if she told them what she knew! But
she couldn’t.</p>

<p class='c008' >Cap’n Phin Davies had said: “I’ll have to ask
you to keep mum” and that was quite enough to
seal Sidney’s lips.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c006'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />POLA</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >For the next few days Mart and Lav found
Sidney strangely quiet. Sidney on her part wondered
if they could not tell, simply by looking at her,
that her uncomfortable heart carried a great secret.
Then something happened that put pirates and secrets
completely out of her mind, something so amazing,
so unexpected, as to turn her world on its head.
Pola came!</p>

<p class='c008' >In her zeal to get out of each day all the joy
that it offered Sidney had forgotten Pola, or at least
she had tucked her idol into a far-back corner of
her mind where it was fast gathering dust.</p>

<p class='c008' >One morning Mart, racing over the sand of the
beach, hailed her. “Sid! Sid! They want us to pose
for them! That Craig woman and the others!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sid gasped, unbelieving. The girls had often
wished they might pose for some of the artists. Mart,
having caught up with her, clutched her arm and
hauled her hurriedly forward toward where little
groups of artists were gathering on the beach in the
shadow of one of the long wharves.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But—but—” Sidney protested breathlessly. It
would be fun to pose, of course, but not dressed
as she was at that moment! Vick, in the picture that
had been hung in Paris, had worn a black velvet
dress which the artist had borrowed for her sitting;
she could run home and don the precious cherry crêpe
de chine that she had not worn since she had come
to Sunset Lane.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Miss Craig said to get that—other—girl—”
Mart was explaining as they ran. “And they’re
waiting.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Miss Craig, a pretty, earnest-eyed woman who
was studying in one of the summer art classes, came
forward to meet them. Her glance went over Sidney’s
figure with enthusiastic approval.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You found her! How nice. Miss Higgins will
pose you—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Can’t I go home and change my dress? I have
an awfully pretty—”</p>

<p class='c008' >But Miss Craig cut Sidney’s appeal short.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Gracious</i> no! Why, that would <i>spoil</i> you!
We want you exactly as you are this moment—both
of you. You’re—you’re <i>precious</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney resented her “precious.” She resented
other remarks that came to their ears as Miss Higgins,
who had charge of the little group, posed them against
an old, overturned dory. “A perfect type—native—girls——freedom——wild
beauty——” She resented
the rotting dory. Vick had leaned against a
crimson velvet chair. Why, her hair had not been
combed since the morning before, her skirt was in
tatters where she had torn it climbing into Top Notch;
she was horribly conscious of her long legs, bare,
brown, and bruised.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney found that posing in the morning sun on
a beach at Provincetown was not the lark Vick had
declared posing for the great Stuart Gelding had
been. But then Vick had flirted a little with Stuart
Gelding and had always had a cup of tea with him
and his wife afterward; these art students appeared
to have forgotten that their models were human
with legs that ached from holding a position and
arms that trembled with very eagerness to move. It
was not one bit of fun.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then, after an interminable time, Miss Craig
called out cheerily; “There, that’s enough for this
morning,” and came down to the dory, opening a
little crocheted bag. From it she took two crisp one
dollar bills. “Take this, girls, and divide it. And
we are ever so grateful—you were splendid types.
We’ll have you again some day.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney’s hand had barely closed over her dollar
bill when she spied a woman and a girl slowly walking
along the wharf, watching with interest the artists
who were still at work. The girl looked startlingly
familiar to Sidney. She gave a little gasp and ran
forward.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Pola!</i>” she called loudly.</p>

<p class='c008' >The girl turned in astonishment at the sound of
her name, stared for a moment, then quickly advanced
laughing.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, you’re the Romley girl, aren’t you? Of
<i>all</i> the things! What are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m visiting my aunt,” explained Sidney, suddenly
conscious of her appearance and in consequence
painfully ill-at-ease.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, and do they hire you to pose? What fun!
I suppose that’s a sort of costume they make you wear,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Y—yes,” Sidney faltered, miserably. Pola’s
manner was prettily condescending and she made no
move to join Sidney on the beach.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m a wreck myself,” Pola went on, airily surveying
her trim and elegant person. “Mother and I
are motoring. And I made her bring me down here
to see my cousin. He’s an artist and lives here summers.
He’ll just despise seeing us because he comes
here to get rid of everything home. And the car’s
broken down and goodness knows how long we’ll
have to stay.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Pola!” Her mother called sharply.</p>

<p class='c008' >Pola waved her hand toward her mother. “Yes,
mamma!” Then, to Sidney, “Isn’t it simply rare our
meeting like this? It shows how small the world is.
I must run now! By-by!” She gave the slightest
flip of her hand in sign of leave-taking and, turning,
ran lightly up the wharf toward her mother.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney’s eyes followed her, devouring her dainty
clothes, the tight-fitting motoring hat, the buckled
pumps. Pola—the Pola she had carried enshrined in
her heart! That heart hurt now, to the core. She
had dreamed of a meeting sometime, somewhere,
had planned just what it would be like and what she’d
say and what Pola would say. And now Pola had
turned a shoulder upon it.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mart’s laugh behind her roused her.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Who’s Guinevere, anyway? Her ma called her
just in time—we might a hurt the doll-baby!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney turned on Mart fiercely. “She’s a friend
of mine,” she cried, in a voice she made rough to
keep the tears from it. “And she’s <i>not</i> a doll-baby.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“All right—go and play with her then—she’s
crazy about you, I guess.” And with that Mart
swung on her heel and stalked away, her head in
the air.</p>

<p class='c008' >Poor Sidney hurried back to Sunset Lane to hide
her humiliation and her dismay. For some reason
she could not understand she had offended Mart.
And Pola had snubbed her. It had indeed been a
cruel fate that had brought Pola out on the wharf
at that precise moment!</p>

<p class='c008' >She spent a lonely afternoon in Top Notch, too
miserable to even pour out her heart to “Dorothea.”
Then she helped Aunt Achsa prepare supper and after
supper, which was lonely, too, for neither Lavender
nor Mr. Dugald were there, she insisted upon clearing
up the dishes while Aunt Achsa went down to Tillie
Higgins’.</p>

<p class='c008' >Swishing her hands in the soapy water Sidney
pondered sadly the things she had longed to learn
of Pola. Her name—why she hadn’t even found
out her name! What had her teacher said of that
theme she had written on her visit to the Romley
house? Where did Pola live? Of course she might
see her again—Pola had said that they’d be in Provincetown
for a few days, but she did not <i>want</i> to
see her; she did not want Pola to see Sunset Lane
and the little gray cottage and Aunt Achsa and Lavender.
Pola would laugh at them and she would
hate her!</p>

<p class='c008' >At that moment footsteps crunched the gravel of
the path and a shadow fell across the kitchen door.
Sidney turned from the table. There stood Mr.
Dugald and with him—Pola.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ve brought my cousin, Sidney. She blew out
to the Cape with that ill-wind we felt this morning.
If you know what we can do with her I’ll be your
slave for life.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Playfully pushing Dugald Allan aside Pola
walked into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Isn’t he horrid? You wouldn’t dream that he’s
really crazy about me, would you? I told him how
we’d met, even before this morning. He’d written
home that Miss Green’s cousin was here but I never
dreamed it was you. I’m so sorry I didn’t have a
chance to introduce you to mother this morning. But
mother wants me to take you back to the hotel. You
can have a room right next to mine and we’ll have
scads of fun—You’ll come, won’t you?” For
Sidney’s face was unyielding.</p>

<p class='c008' >Like one cornered, Sidney stood straight against
the table, her hands, red from the hot dish water,
clasped tightly behind her back. Though she knew
that Pola was trying to make amends for her rudeness
of the morning, something within her heart
turned hard. The dusty idol was crumbling to bits
of clay.</p>

<p class='c008' >“She’s only inviting me because Mr. Dugald has
told her to,” she reasoned inwardly. And aloud she
answered in a steady voice:</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m sorry, but I simply can’t leave Aunt Achsa.
You must come here and we’ll find lots of jolly things
to do—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Here?” laughed Pola, glancing around the old
kitchen.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why not here?” roared Mr. Dugald. “As
long as you’ve broken into our Secret Garden we’ll
introduce you to some things you’ve never done before
in your life. Only Sid will have to find some
suitable clothes for you, and you’d better leave your
complexion on the dressing table.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Pola accepted his banter good-naturedly. “I
shall be deeply grateful, old dear, if you <i>will</i> introduce
me to any sensations I have not experienced
before. There, now, will that hold you for awhile?”
She turned to Sidney. “We quarrel like this all the
time, but it’s fun and I always have the last word.
I make him so mad he can’t think of anything withering
enough to say and I seize that strategic moment
to cease firing. You see, I practice on Dug. I <i>will</i>
come tomorrow if I may. Now, Duggie dear, lead
me out of this funny lane or else I’ll <i>never</i> find my
way back to mamma. Goodby, Miss Romley.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Behind Pola’s back Mr. Dugald cast such a
despairing, apologetic and altogether furious look
toward Sidney as to make Sidney suddenly laugh.
And with her laugh all her sense of dismay and
humiliation vanished. She forgot her red hands and
the big gingham apron and the dishes spread about
her in her amusement over Pola’s pathetic attempt
to be very grown-up and sophisticated. And <i>so</i> ill-bred!
How ashamed Mr. Dugald had been of her!</p>

<p class='c008' >Then a thought struck Sidney with such force
that she sat down in the nearest chair. Why, if Mr.
Dugald was Pola’s own cousin, belonged to the
grandeur that was Pola’s, he would <i>never</i> be
attracted by poor, plain Trude. Her beautiful hopes
were shattered! She felt distinctly aggrieved.</p>

<p class='c008' >However, there was Vick. Sidney hated to give
Mr. Dugald to Vick, who always got everything, yet
it seemed the only thing to do if any of the sisters
were to have him. Almost sadly she went to her
room, opened her satchel and took from it a small
framed photograph of Victoria, a photograph which,
while it did not flatter Victoria, paid full justice to
her enticing beauty. Considering it, Sidney reflected
on how lucky it was that at the last moment she had
put the pictures of her sisters into her baggage. Then
she carried it to the kitchen and stood it on the narrow
mantel next to the clock where Mr. Dugald’s
eyes must surely find it. Unlike the snapshot of
Trude the picture remained there undisturbed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />PEACOCKS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Early the next day Pola appeared with Mr.
Dugald in Sunset Lane in a simple garb that must
have satisfied even her exacting cousin. Her mood
was in accord with her attire as though she had left
her sophistication behind with her silks and her rouge.
She declared she felt as “peppy as they make them”
and ready to do anything anyone suggested. And
Mr. Dugald, resigned to wasting two weeks to entertaining
his young cousin, of whom he was really very
fond, promptly offered an astonishing assortment of
suggestions from which he commanded the girls to
choose.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, you wouldn’t believe there were so many
things to do!” cried Pola with real enthusiasm. “Sidney,
you’ll have to decide.” And Sidney at once
decided upon a tramp to Peaked Hill on the ocean
side with an early picnic supper.</p>

<p class='c008' >In the days that followed, Sidney’s first admiration
for Pola returned. Though Pola would never
again be the idol she was much more enjoyable as a
chum. Her spirits, though an affectation, were
infectious and gay; in her pretty clothes and with
her pretty face she made Sidney think of a butterfly,
a fragile, golden-winged, dainty flitting butterfly.
She professed to enjoy everything they did—even
to the picnics. She tramped endlessly in her unsuitable
shoes without a murmur of fatigue and Sidney
suspected that she really <i>did</i> care a great deal for her
cousin Dugald’s approval.</p>

<p class='c008' >With Mr. Dugald they motored to Highland Light
and to Chatham. They toured the shops at Hyannis.
They sailed with Captain Hawkes on the <i>Mabel T</i>.
They rose very early one morning and went to the
Coast Guard Station to watch the drill and then ate
ham and eggs with Commander Nelson. More than
once Sidney donned the cherry crêpe de chine and
dined with Mrs. Allan and Pola and Dugald at the
hotel, feeling very grand and traveled.</p>

<p class='c008' >But to Sidney’s deep regret Pola professed an
abhorrence of swimming.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just please don’t <i>ask</i> me,” she had begged, shuddering.
“I loathe it! It’s one of my complexes.
Of course I’ve gone swimming in almost every body
of water on the globe, but I hate it. You’ll spoil
my fun <i>utterly</i> if you even try to make me!” After
that Sidney could not urge. She did not know what
complexes were, but Pola had made them sound real
and convincing and a little delicate. Though Sidney
missed the jolly swims with Lavender and Mart she
refrained from even a hint of her feelings.</p>

<p class='c008' >Often when they were together Pola waxed confidential
over her cousin. “He’s a thorn in Aunt
Lucy’s side,” she explained one day as the girls
lounged in Pola’s room at the hotel, a huge box of
candy on a stool between them. “She always wants
him to go in for society and to go abroad with her
and do all the fashionable resorts on the Continent,
but couldn’t you <i>see</i> him? Not for Duggie boy, ever!
When she starts planning something like that he bolts
off somewhere and the next thing you hear is that
he’s painted a wonderful picture and sold it or had
first mention or a gold medal. Of course that makes
him terribly interesting and there are dozens of single
ladies from forty to fourteen itching to catch him.
And Dug’s such a simple old dear that he doesn’t
know it. But his mother does and she has them all
sorted over and the eligible ones ticketed. You see
Dug will be dreadfully rich some day and goodness
knows what he’ll do with the money for he hasn’t
the brains of a child where business is concerned.
His father’s even richer than Dad.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney literally blinked before the picture Pola
drew—blinked and blushed that she had dared angle
for Mr. Dugald herself like the forty-to-fourteen
single ladies. Mr. Dugald belonged to a world that
was foreign to the Romley girls, Pola’s dazzling,
peacock-world.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney felt immensely flattered that Pola had
taken her in among her peacocks. (Secretly, too,
she considered that she carried herself well among
them. She was most careful of her dress, now!)
She did not know that Pola’s sort instinctively seeks
out someone to dazzle, that Pola’s generosity was a
part of the dazzling process. She thought Pola wonderful
to accept so casually her gilded privileges.
Why, if Pola didn’t like a dress or a hat or a pair
of shoes she simply didn’t wear it; she could buy
anything she wanted from any one of the priceless
bits of jewelry in the shops at Hyannis to the delectable
sweets in the tea-rooms on Commercial Street.
She could do just as she pleased—even more than
Mart, for <i>she</i> never had to darn or mend or wipe
dishes or dust or hang up her clothes or brush them.
Realizing all this Sidney came to forgive that first
condescension that had stung; she thought Pola little
short of an angel to be so prettily friendly with
them all.</p>

<p class='c008' >So engrossed was Sidney in basking in Pola’s
favor that for a time she felt no compunctions at
deserting Mart and Lavender; in fact she did not
even think of them. Both Mart and Lavender had
become suddenly very busy with affairs that kept
them out of sight. If, once in awhile, Sidney wondered
what they were doing something of Pola’s or
something Pola said quickly crowded the thought
from her head. But one afternoon they encountered
Mart as they strolled toward the Green Lantern to
sit under its gay awnings and drink tea. Sidney
introduced Mart to Pola and to cover Pola’s rude
stare she added quickly: “We’re going down to the
Green Lantern, Mart. Won’t you come with us?”
conscious as she said it that her voice sounded stilted.</p>

<p class='c008' >“No, thanks. I’m going to do something lots
more exciting than sitting <i>there</i>! And I’m in a hurry,
too.” And with that Mart swung on past them,
her head high.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney had a moment’s longing to run after her
and coax her to come, but Pola’s light giggle checked
her. “Isn’t she a riot? I’d have <i>died</i> if she’d come
with us!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Pola—she’ll hear you!” pleaded Sidney.</p>

<p class='c008' >She hated herself because she did not tell Pola
at once how bravely Mart shouldered her responsibilities,
about gran’ma, who looked to Mart for everything.
Instead she simply walked along with Pola
and let Pola giggle. Pola, sensing Sidney’s feelings,
slipped her arm through hers and gave it an affectionate
little squeeze.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You’re such a funny child,” she said softly.
“You’d be nice to anything. I can’t, of course, for
I go around to so many places and mother’s warned
me often about strangers. Anyway, it’s lots nicer
for just us two to be together, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008' >But in spite of Pola’s soft flattery and countless
lumps of sugar the tea tasted bitter to Sidney and
the Green Lantern, with its futurist awnings, its
bizarre hangings and cushions, had no allure. The
thought came suddenly to Sidney that it had been a
whole week since she had even seen Mart; in that
time she had scarcely exchanged more than a half
dozen words with Lavender.</p>

<p class='c008' >To the tune of Pola’s ceaseless chatter Sidney’s
thoughts kept darting back to that uncomfortable
fact. Pola always talked of things she had done at
home, abroad, at school, of her boy friends whom
she called “men.” She liked to hint of countless
“affairs” which simply must not come to her mother’s
attention, assuring Sidney that she was absolutely the
only one to whom she confided these deep intrigues.
She had worn Guy Townsend’s fraternity pin the
whole winter before and not a soul had known whose
pin it was for Guy was tabooed by mothers in general
and Mrs. Allan in particular. Now Pola was simply
crazy over a Jack Sicard who was playing the lead
in “Hearts Aquiver.” But not even Jack’s manly
beauty, as described by Pola, failed to draw from
Sidney more than a mild: “He must be cute.” Pola
gave way to vexation.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You’re scarcely listening to me, Sidney Romley,
when I’m telling you things I haven’t told a <i>soul</i>!
I believe you’re still thinking of that ridiculous girl
we met.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“She isn’t ridiculous!” Sidney was prompt
enough now in Mart’s defense. “She looks funny,
but you see I’ve gotten well acquainted with her and
she’s awfully nice.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, <i>nice</i>, of course! But <i>anyone</i> can be nice!
You know perfectly well, Sidney, that there’s as
much class in this country as there is in Europe and
being <i>nice</i> does not break down social barriers.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney had no answer ready for this. Curiously
into her mind flashed what Mr. Dugald had said about
the solid aristocracy. But somehow she knew Pola
would not understand this. Pola went on:</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m a dreadful little snob, anyway. But I suppose
that is the result of my education. It would be
funny to go to the most expensive schools and have
all the culture that Europe can offer and <i>not</i> be
a snob.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Still Sidney stared into her teacup. She thought
Pola was all wrong, but she did not know how to
say it. Pola herself had told her that she had gone
to Grace Hall because it had no examinations and
graduated a girl anyway—so much for Pola’s education.
And culture—what benefited all the culture
of Europe if Pola found enjoyment only in the
company of youths her mother would not permit in
the house?</p>

<p class='c008' >Pola mistook Sidney’s silence for hurt. “You
goose, I’m not saying I think I’m any better than <i>you</i>
are! But you must see that neither of us are a bit
like that native girl!” Which admission Pola considered
most generous.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I wasn’t thinking about whether you are any
better than I am or not. I’ve been brought up, you
see,” with a rueful laugh, “to believe that my father
being a poet set <i>me</i> a little apart from everyone else.
And I’ve hated it. What I was thinking was that
there really isn’t any class difference in people—except
what we make ourselves, like the League building
a barrier around me and you thinking you’re
in another class from Mart because you’re rich. Maybe
it isn’t really the outside things that count, maybe
it’s the big things we have got or haven’t got inside
us—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Like what?” demanded Pola.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney was thinking of Lav’s self-effacing ambition
to serve the world from the seclusion of a laboratory,
of Mart’s cheerfulness in the face of her lot
and her loyal affection for her exacting and rheumatic
grandmother; of the courage of Mart’s grandfather,
Ambrose Calkins, who had lost his own life
in going back to his sinking schooner for the cook
who could not swim; of her own ancestor, Priscilla
Ellis. <i>Those</i> were the things which set people apart
from their fellows, Sidney thought, but the understanding
was too new in her own heart for her to
find words in which she could tell Pola of it. “Like
what?” Pola demanded again and this time her voice
was a little haughty.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, I don’t know,” Sidney laughed. “I’m all
mixed up. I guess I was trying to say something Mr.
Dugald said once to me.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, <i>Dug</i>!” laughed Pola. “He’s nutty about
all that! Look at the way he lives here on the Cape.
But mother says he’ll get over it when he marries.
Now I have no intention of getting serious this grand
day so let’s have another piece of that chocolate fudge
cake—it’s on me, too, remember!” Which was
Pola’s pretty way of pretending she did not know that
Sidney did not have any money with her. The dollar
Sidney had earned for posing had long since been
spent.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney was relieved that Pola had rescued her
from the “deep water.” At the same time she suffered
from the sense that she had not made Pola see
Mart in another light. She had failed in loyalty.
The sparkling blue of the bay that stretched before
them only reminded her that this was the hour she
usually went swimming. Due to Pola’s “complex”
she had not gone swimming for a whole week.</p>

<p class='c008' >Even with her mouth full of the fudge cake, she
vowed to herself that the very next day she would
hunt out her chums and her old pastimes. Pola and
Mr. Dugald must plan without her!</p>

<p class='c008' >She had promised to dine again at the hotel with
Pola and her mother but as soon as she could after
dinner she returned to Sunset Lane. Because of her
determination her heart was lighter. And her way
was made easier, too, for Mrs. Allan had told Pola
at dinner that the “Truxtons were at Chatham Bars.”
Pola had been as excited over the Truxtons as her
mother.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Can we go and see them right away?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not tonight. But I have arranged for a car
and Shields will drive us over tomorrow. We can
stay there for a few days. I shall welcome the change
for this place has been very stupid for me, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Poor mamma! I’ve been selfish. It’ll be a lark
seeing Cora Truxton again!” Pola had explained
to Sidney: “We met the Truxtons at Nice. Cora
and Millicent are both older, but they’re the <i>cutest</i>
girls. Will we go in the morning, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Pola’s manner had indicated that the coming of
the Truxtons into their plans raised a barrier that
now excluded Sidney. Throughout the dinner she
had talked exclusively of the trip on the morrow and
the renewing of that acquaintance that had begun
in Nice. But Sidney felt nothing but a sense of
escape.</p>

<p class='c008' >She found Aunt Achsa alone in the cottage on
Sunset Lane. She was sitting on the doorstep,
“coolin’ off.” Sidney sat down beside her.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Where’s Lavender?” she asked, wishing Lavender
was at home that she might begin her “making
up” at once.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t know. And I wish I did. Don’t know
what’s gotten into that boy. I’m as worried as
can be.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“About Lav? Oh, what’s the matter?” For
Aunt Achsa was close to tears. Something must have
happened to break her habitual optimism.</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’s acted so queer like lately. Cal’late you’d
of noticed it if you hadn’t been off so much with Mr.
Dugald’s folks. I thought it might a’ been his stomach
and I put a powder into his coffee, but he ain’t
been a mite different—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But what does he do, Aunt Achsa? He looks
all right—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Now Aunt Achsa hesitated. One tear separated
itself from its fellows and rolled down her withered
cheek and dropped upon her withered hand. She
looked at it, startled, then lifted her hand and dashed
it across her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I swum, I’m cryin’. Don’t know as I know
when I’ve cried before. And cryin’ before I have
anything as I can see to cry for. But Sidney, I set
such a lot on that boy—it’s like I was his mother
and his father and his brothers and his sisters all
mixed up in one—gran’ma, too. He was such a
little mite when I took him, y’see and then he’s not
like other boys and I’ve had to do a heap of lovin’
to make up to him. I’ve prayed every day of my life
for the Lord to keep him happy in spite of things and
that was a pretty big prayer for I don’t suppose the
Lord wants us all to be happy all the time, that ain’t
His way of bringing us up. But I thought He might
make an exception for Lav. Land sakes, how I go on—and
you nigh to cryin’ yourself.” For she had
caught Sidney blinking back something glistening
from her own eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aunt Achsa, Lavender is wonderful. He’s
talked to me a lot and he’s going to be a great man
some day, I know. He has the grandest plans shut
away in his heart and he <i>is</i> happy—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Aunt Achsa looked at her, startled. “Plans—how
<i>can</i> he when he’s—” She bit off the words.
Her lips trembled.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aunt Achsa, it doesn’t matter what one’s like
on the outside!” Now Sidney floundered for the
second time in one day under the pressure of her
own thoughts. “I mean—Lav can do anything he
wants to do, anyway. And he’s working hard reading
and studying and some day, after awhile, he’ll go
away somewhere and study more—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sidney Romley, you’re <i>crazy</i>!” cried Aunt
Achsa, in a quavering voice. “Go away! How <i>can</i>
he go away when we ain’t even the money to go ’sfar
as Orleans. And he ain’t plannin’ to go on anyone’s
<i>charity</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, I don’t mean he’s going away <i>soon</i>! I
shouldn’t have told anyway for Lav told me as a
secret. But I thought maybe it would make you
happier knowing he had great ambitions. And he’ll
tell you sometime himself.”</p>

<p class='c008' >When Aunt Achsa spoke it was in a thin, grieved
voice.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s what I didn’t want him to ever take into
his head. Goin’ off somewhere—alone. For I’m too
old to go with him and he’ll need me!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh I wouldn’t have told you if I’d thought it
would make you unhappy. He won’t go for a long
time, Aunt Achsa. And when he does he’ll come
back real often.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Now Aunt Achsa sat so still that Sidney thought
she had consoled her. But Aunt Achsa was facing
in her own way this at which Sidney had hinted, drawing
for it from that courage of hers that had not yet
been exhausted. Well, if it was best for Lavender
some day to go away she’d send him away with a
smile even though the heart that had taken him, a
wee baby, from the dying mother did burst with
loneliness. Besides, even if Lavender went away
she could go on praying to the Lord to keep him
“happy”—no distance could keep her from doing
that!</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s like as not his plans in his head that’s makin’
him act so quiet like and short-spoken. And
last night he didn’t sleep in his bed at all!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, Aunt Achsa, where <i>was</i> he?” gasped Sidney,
really startled.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t know, dearie. He used to take to spells
like that when he was little. But lately he’s got over
them. I followed him once and I found him out
in the sand dunes lying flat on his face cryin’ awful—out
loud and beatin’ his arms. I let him be. I
stole home and I never let on I knew. When he came
back all white lookin’ I had a nice cake ready—roll
jell, his favorite.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Do—do you think he was out in the sand
dunes—last night?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t know. He come in about nine o’clock,
awful quiet and I didn’t ask him anything, but I
just set his breakfast before him as though the morning
wa’n’t half over. And then he went off again
and I ain’t seen him sense. I thought mebbe it was
these folks of Mr. Dugald’s—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What do you mean, Aunt Achsa?” But Sidney
knew what she meant.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Like as not Lav’s plain jealous. Mr. Dugald
hasn’t had any time for anything but toting this Pola
round everywhere and Lav notices it. He hasn’t any
right to be jealous as I can see for Miss Pola is Mr.
Dugald’s own cousin, but Lav thinks the sun rises
and sets in Mr. Dugald. And like as not he misses
you—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ve missed Lav dreadfully. I didn’t know how
much I missed him and Mart until today when it
came over me suddenly that the things I was doing
with Pola weren’t really much fun—just at first they
were because they were different. I’m afraid, Aunt
Achsa, that I love different things! But tomorrow
I am going to play all day long with Lav and Mart,
see if I don’t. I can’t wait for tomorrow to come!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />“HOOK!”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Sidney found it a little difficult to take up the
fun with her erstwhile chums where she had left off.
When she stopped at the Calkins’ house directly after
breakfast, Mart coolly declined to go anywhere with
her, and smiled scornfully at her bare legs.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I s’pose your million-dollar friend is otherwise
engaged today!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney truthfully admitted that she was. “She’s
gone to Chatham with her mother to see some people
they know. And I’m glad. I’ve been just dying
for a good swim. Let’s go out to the <i>Arabella</i> this
morning.”</p>

<p class='c008' >But Mart declared she was tired of all that. In
fact she was tired of doing lots of the silly things
they’d been doing. She’d promised Gert Bartow to
go there right after lunch.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney had no choice but to go on alone in search
of Lav. She was discouraged to the point of tears.
Yet she knew in her heart that she deserved Mart’s
coldness. She remembered how she had felt once
when Nancy had deserted her for a new girl at Miss
Downs’. And it had seriously threatened their
friendship.</p>

<p class='c008' >As she wandered slowly toward the town Sidney
wondered what Mart and Gert Bartow were going
to do. Gert Bartow was a girl of nineteen at least,
and much more grown up than even that. Mart had
pointed her out to Sidney. Sidney wished Mart had
asked her to go with her to Gert’s. She felt very
lonely.</p>

<p class='c008' >Perhaps she had spoiled everything. Pola would
come back, of course, but, somehow, Pola’s glamour
had faded. After all, what, besides tons of candy
and quarts of sweet mixtures and much glitter, had
there been to it? The sweets and the glitter and
Pola’s endless confidences of “men” had left Sidney
jaded and bored, though she did not know it; she did
know that she was suddenly lonely for Mart and
Lav and the stimulating pastimes they seemed to find
always right at hand.</p>

<p class='c008' >As she approached Rockman’s, wandering there
from force of habit, she saw Lav pushing off in a
dory. She ran down the wharf, hailing him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Lav, take me with you!” she pleaded,
breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c008' >He hesitated a moment before he swung the dory
back to the wharf. Something of the look Mart
had given her flashed into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then: “Come on if y’want to,” he answered
ungraciously.</p>

<p class='c008' >As she sat down in the bow of the boat Sidney
wanted to cry more than anything else, but Lav’s
dark face suddenly reminded her of what Aunt Achsa
had told her. Perhaps he had been out in the sand
dunes last night, lying on his face, sobbing aloud!
She began chattering with resolute cheerfulness.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Isn’t it hot this morning, Lav? Where are
you going?” Lav answered shortly that he was
going out to the <i>Arabella</i>. Sidney noticed a book in
his pocket, but said nothing. She ventured other
remarks concerning the activities in the bay to which
Lavender answered in monosyllables, if at all.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, look, the <i>Puritan’s</i> in, Lav!” And even
to this Lavender only grunted: “It’s been in two
days!”</p>

<p class='c008' >By the time they reached the <i>Arabella</i> Sidney’s
remorse was yielding to a spark of indignation. Lav
needn’t be <i>quite</i> so mad for, after all, it had been
his own precious Mr. Dugald who had thrown her
and Pola so constantly together! And if Lav had
not hidden himself away he most certainly would have
been included in all the plans. It was not fair in
Lav to act so cross.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I know you came out to read, Lav, and I’ve
some thinking to do, so I’m going up in the bow and
leave you quite to yourself,” Sidney said as they
boarded the <i>Arabella</i>, and if in her tone there was
something of Mart’s tartness, it may be forgiven for
Sidney had been punished enough.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t care if you hang ’round,” Lav conceded.
“It’s too hot to read, anyways. I thought maybe
there’d be a breeze out here. What’s that?” For
he had suddenly spied an object lying on the deck
close to the rail as though it had dropped there from
someone’s pocket.</p>

<p class='c008' >At almost the same moment Sidney spied it, too.
Both darted for it. Lavender reached it first and
picked it up and examined it with frowning eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s a knife!” cried Sidney, at his elbow.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure it’s a knife. Anybody can see that. What
I want to know—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Let me look at it. Isn’t it Mr. Dugald’s?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“No, it isn’t Mr. Dugald’s. He hasn’t been out
here for a week. And that knife wasn’t here yesterday
for I’d a’ seen it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Let me look at it, Lav,” pleaded Sidney, for
Lav, a curious expression on his face, had covered
the knife with his hand.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s funny, that’s all I got to say. I mean—how
it come here.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Lavender Green, show me that knife this minute!
You act so mysterious and I have a right to know
why.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Slowly Lavender placed the knife in Sidney’s
eager hands. It was an ordinary case knife such as
the fishermen carried, but Lavender pointed to two
initials that had been carved on the case.</p>

<p class='c008' >“J.S.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“J.S.” repeated Sidney; then she cried: “Why—J.S.!
That’s Jed Starrow!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sure it’s Jed Starrow!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But how did it get on the <i>Arabella</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s what I’d like to know.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“He’s <i>been</i> on the <i>Arabella</i>, Lav!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Or someone of his gang.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Isn’t that <i>funny</i>? What would he come here
for?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Lavender was silent. And Sidney, staring at him
as though to read from his face some explanation,
suddenly fell silent, too. The secret that Cap’n Davies
had laid upon her weighed heavily. She <i>wished</i> she
could tell.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sid, I haven’t played square,” Lavender suddenly
blurted out, flushing. “We promised to tell
one another if any one of us found out anything and
<i>I did</i>—and I didn’t tell!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Lavender’s admission faded beside the fact that
he knew something.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, what?” Sidney cried.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I wasn’t going to tell you. I thought you
didn’t care anything about the pirates any more. And
the laugh’s sort o’ on me, anyway, because I thought
we were all crazy to suspect Jed Starrow.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Tell me quick, Lav,” commanded Sidney, quivering
with excitement.</p>

<p class='c008' >Lav leaned against the rail. To tell his story
meant confessing his state of mind.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I guess I’ve been sore because you and Mr.
Dugald fooled ’round with those new folks. Jealous.
I get that way lots of times—all hot inside because
I’m different. And I go off somewhere alone and stay
there until I fight it down.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I know, Lav. Aunt Achsa told me. Did you
go to the dunes?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“One night I did. Stayed there all night. But
one evening I went out on the breakwall. There’s a
place out there where the rocks are piled so’s to make
a cave. I used to play there a lot when I was a little
kid. I crawled into it. And I hadn’t been there very
long when I heard somebody talking—two men.
They were up close so’s I heard everything they said.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“And what did they say, Lav? Oh, tell me
quick!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I could only get scraps of it. I didn’t dare
look, I didn’t dare move. But one fellow called the
other Jed. I heard ’em say something about ‘risk’
and a ‘stranger from Boston asking too many questions
’round Rockman’s to be healthy,’ and Jed Starrow—I’m
dead sure it was his voice—said, sort of
blustering like, ‘Let them search the <i>Puritan</i>! They
won’t find anything on her <i>now</i>!’ And the other fellow
answered him: ‘There’s too much in this, Jed,
to take any chances.’ That’s what they said, Sid,
and then they went on.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Lav, they’re pirates!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, not exactly pirates, but they’re up to
<i>something</i> that’s sure. Maybe they’re rum-runners.
There’s a lot of that going on. I thought you were
crazy, but I guess you weren’t.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney’s lips trembled with eagerness. As long
as Lavender knew what he knew she felt that she
would be justified in telling him what Cap’n Davies
had told her.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It isn’t rum—Lav,” she whispered, “It’s <i>diamonds</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Diamonds! Oh, go on, where did you get that
stuff?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s diamonds, Lav.” Then Sidney solemnly
repeated what the old Captain had told her concerning
the letter and the reward. “He asked me not to
tell a soul, but you’re different because you know.
And he said that the reward would be posted everywhere
in two weeks at least and it’s that long now.
Everyone will know soon.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sid, five thousand dollars!” Lavender whistled.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If someone ’round here’s doing it Cap’n Davies
wants to catch him himself. He says he doesn’t want
the reward but he wants to punish the man who’s hurting
the honest name of this part of Cape Cod. I think
that’s a grand spirit.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Lavender’s shoulders lifted. Why couldn’t someone
else save the fair name of Cape Cod—someone
like a crippled boy whom most of the towns-people
looked upon as a loafer?</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’d like to catch ’em, myself,” he said slowly
in such a low voice that Sidney barely caught the
words.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Lav, why not? We have as good a chance
as anyone, knowing as much as we do. What’ll we do
first?” For Sidney was ready for adventure.</p>

<p class='c008' >Suddenly Lavender realized that he was gripping
the knife in his hand. He looked down at it.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What we ought to do first is to find out how
this knife got here. Let’s put it where we found it
and go back around the other side of that schooner
so’s no one on the <i>Puritan</i>’ll see us. Then we can
come out late this afternoon and if it’s gone—well,
we’ll know someone came to look for it!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“And then we’d know for sure that someone had
been on the <i>Arabella</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s the idea. You get on quickly for a girl,
Sid. Come on, now, we’ll pull the dory round to the
starboard side.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney caught herself tiptoeing across the deck
of the<i> Arabella</i>. In her excitement she scarcely
breathed. Every move, every act, was fraught with
significance. Lavender took the precaution to beach
the dory at an abandoned wharf near Sunset Lane.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Just as well not to show ourselves ’round Rockman’s.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“When can we go out to the <i>Arabella</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Not ’till four o’clock. We can go out to swim
just like we always do. Even if they see us they
won’t think it’s funny for us to do that. They’d
think it funnier if we didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney admitted the truth of this, but wondered
how she could live until four o’clock!</p>

<p class='c008' >As they walked up Sunset Lane Sidney reminded
Lavender that, because of their promise, they ought
to tell Mart. But when they stopped at the Calkins’
house they found that Mart had already gone to
Gert Bartow’s.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, dear,” sighed Sidney, with an added pang
of remorse.</p>

<p class='c008' >At four o’clock Sidney and Lavender went out
to the <i>Arabella</i> to swim as they had done always
before Pola’s coming. Except for a brightness in
Sidney’s eyes, an alertness about her whole body, and
the occasional significant glances that passed between
them they both appeared quite normal. Lav talked
casually of the heat of the day.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee, the water’ll feel great. This is the hottest
day we’ve had yet.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I can’t wait to get in.” Most certainly Jed
Starrow, had he been listening, could not have guessed
how closely Nemesis pressed upon his heels!</p>

<p class='c008' >Lavender pulled up alongside of the <i>Arabella</i>
and deliberately made the boat fast.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We got to act as though we haven’t found the
knife, y’see,” he warned. “As though we were going
just swimming.”</p>

<p class='c008' >In her eagerness to board the <i>Arabella</i> Sidney
stumbled. Lavender had to clutch her to keep her
from tumbling into the water.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh!” They both cried in one sound as they
clambered to the deck—for the knife was gone!</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, <i>that</i> means they’d been on the <i>Arabella</i>.
Jed Starrow dropped that knife and he missed it
and came back to look for it!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Lav, I believe they’ve hidden their treasure on
the <i>Arabella</i>!” Sidney still reverted to the more
romantic terms of buccaneering. “Let’s look for
it now!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“With ’em watching maybe from the <i>Puritan</i>?
I guess not. We got to go ahead and swim the
way we always do, Sid. Don’t let’s even appear to
be talking about anything. Come on, I’ll beat you in!”</p>

<p class='c008' >For the space of the few minutes while the
water closed about her with delicious coolness Sidney
forgot everything in an intoxication of delight. Presently
she came back to the <i>Arabella</i> and climbed
aboard with a sigh of utter content. “Thank goodness
<i>I</i> haven’t any complexes,” she laughed, shaking
the salt drops from her bobbed head. “And now
what?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Lavender pulled on the light sweater he had worn
over his bathing suit.</p>

<p class='c008' >“When it gets dark I’m coming out to the <i>Arabella</i>
and stay all night. Maybe they’ll come back and
I’ll find out why. That fellow said something ’bout
Rockman’s not being safe. They’ll learn the <i>Arabella</i>
isn’t safe either!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But Lav, I’m coming with you!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You can’t. And this isn’t any work for a girl
to get mixed up in.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney drew herself to her full height.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Lavender Green, if you think you’re going to
lose me <i>now</i> you’re mistaken. I guess we went into
this in a sort of partnership and it’s going to hold. I
found out just as much as you did! And if you come
out to the <i>Arabella</i>, <i>I’m</i> coming, and Mart, too, if
she’s home.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Lav still hesitated.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Aunt Achsa won’t let you. How’d you get away?”</p>

<p class='c008' >This staggered Sidney for a moment, then she
thought of a “way.” This was Wednesday night
and Miss Letty had said that on Wednesday night
she was going to drive to Truro and that Sidney
might go with her. From Truro Miss Letty was
going on to Wellfleet. Aunt Achsa would think Sidney
wanted to see Cap’n Davies again. She explained
all this breathlessly to Lavender. “This is important
enough to warrant a fib. And when it’s all over Aunt
Achsa will understand. Let’s go home now and
find Mart.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Unwillingly Lavender conceded Sidney’s right
to share with him his night’s vigil at any cost. Again
they beached the dory near Sunset Lane.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now they found Mart at home. Sidney put her
head in the door, made certain that gran’ma was not
in hearing, and cried “Hook!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Mart had only to look once at Sidney’s face to
know that something had happened. Sidney dragged
her out to the Lane and there she and Lavender, in
words as quick as pistol shots, told the story.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Meet us down on the beach near Milligan’s at
eight o’clock,” Lav whispered, as they parted.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />THE GLEAM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Exactly at the appointed hour Sidney met Lavender
on the beach. She was breathless and a little
worried for it had been neither easy nor to her liking
to deceive Aunt Achsa. Aunt Achsa had declared that
a storm was “comin’” for she could smell it in the
air and Tillie Higgins had seen Sam Doolittle start
for the backside with his pike pole and that meant
a blow for Sam didn’t waste steps. “’Tisn’t likely
Letty Vine’ll <i>go</i> to Truro tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But I’ll <i>see</i> if she’s going, anyway,” Sidney had
cried and had raced off, a sweater over her arm.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I wish I could tell her how very important it
is and then she’d understand, but I can’t for maybe
she wouldn’t understand,” Sidney thought as she hurried
to the rendezvous.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Gee, how’d you ever get away?” asked Lav,
admiringly, but Sidney had no opportunity to explain
for at that moment Mart joined them, eager and
excited.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I put some cookies in my pocket,” she exclaimed.
“You can’t tell what’ll happen.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Good. And I’ve got matches.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney wished she had thought of something to
bring. Lav went on:</p>

<p class='c008' >“It isn’t dark enough to go out yet. We got
to be awful careful. You girls sort o’ walk up the
beach as though we weren’t all together.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Lavender was actually pale and his eyes burned
fiercely. Sidney looked at him admiringly. She
knew he was not thinking of the reward but of the
fair name of the Cape.</p>

<p class='c008' >Obediently the girls strolled up the beach. And,
as they turned, a voice hailed them. To their consternation
Pola came flying toward them.</p>

<p class='c008' >At sight of her Sidney bit her lips with vexation.
She gave a sidewise glance at Mart and saw Mart’s
chin set stubbornly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sidney—wait a minute!” Pola called and Sidney
could do nothing but wait until Pola came up
to them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I thought you were going to stay in Chatham
tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I should say <i>not</i>!” Pola had enough breath
to make her answer expressive. “I was never so
bored in my life. Those Truxton girls are <i>stupid</i>.
And I kept wondering what you were doing. I
coaxed mother to let Shields bring me back and she
said she would provided I came and stayed with you
tonight. Can you squeeze me in? Dug will give
me his room, I know.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney cast a wild glance toward Mart. She
started to answer, then stopped. Pola looked from
her to Mart and back again to Sidney.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What’s the mystery? If you don’t want me
I’ll go to the hotel.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Pola, it isn’t that. It’s—it’s—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sidney Romley I’ll bet you’re up to something!
And if you are, you simply have got to let me in on
it! I’m just pepped up to some excitement. Tell me
what’s up.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The girls turned slowly and walked toward Lav
and the dory, Pola between them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It isn’t any fun,” Sidney explained slowly. “It’s
something serious—and—and dangerous. And you’ll
have to ask Mart and Lav if you can come with us.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You’ll let me go, won’t you, Mart?” Pola
begged with friendly entreaty, forgetting she had ever
thought Mart a riot.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney introduced Pola to Lavender and turned
away that she might not see the pain that flashed
across Lavender’s face.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Pola came back to stay all night with me. She
wants to go with us and if she doesn’t I guess I’ll
have to go back home.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll do anything you say,” promised Pola. “I’m
so curious that I’m fairly bursting.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t care, but you’ll have to take off your
shoes and stockings,” muttered Lav, scarcely looking
at Pola.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, I’ll do that! I’ll do <i>anything</i>!” Pola
flopped upon the beach and commenced removing her
sport shoes. “And I won’t even ask any questions
until you’re ready to tell me.” Rising, her small
feet pink against the sand, she saluted Lav with
mock solemnity.</p>

<p class='c008' >“There, Captain Lavender Green, I’m at your
command.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Her pretty acquiescence won the girls at once. If
any doubt assailed them as to the prudence of letting
Pola go, their admiration for Pola’s gameness stilled
it. Sidney rolled Pola’s shoes and stockings and her
own in her sweater and hid them behind some logs.
Then the little party waded out to the dory and
embarked.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’re going to the <i>Arabella</i>,” Sidney whispered
to Pola. She felt Pola shiver, but the girl made no
protest. “We have to go ’round this way so’s no
one can see us from the harbor. Sh—h!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Silently they boarded the old hull, Lavender last.
With the line from the dory in his hand the boy
considered.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If anyone comes up and sees the dory they’ll
know someone’s aboard.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“That’s true. What’ll we do?” whispered Sidney,
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We can set her adrift. It’s an old tub anyway.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But how’ll we get ashore?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“The tide’ll be out towards morning.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You mean <i>swim</i>?” cried Pola. “But I <i>can’t</i>
swim! I—I—”</p>

<p class='c008' >True, Pola’s complex! Sidney hastened to reassure
her.</p>

<p class='c008' >“When the tide’s out it won’t be over your head.
And I’ll help you.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Lavender had already let the line of the dory
slip out of his hand. They saw the old boat become
a shadowy outline as the tide carried it slowly away,
then—nothing. Pola caught Sidney’s hand and
held it.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m not frightened—but it’s so—<i>spooky</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >It had been decided that they should conceal themselves
in the fo’castle cabin. They groped their way
forward, Sidney guiding Pola in the dark, for Lavender
dared not light any of his matches. Stumbling,
scarcely breathing, they slipped down the companion
ladder and crawled into the small, ill-ventilated cabin.
Sidney sat down upon some tarpaulins. Pola
crouched close to Sidney’s side. Lav and Mart
stowed themselves upon one of the bunks.</p>

<p class='c008' >“There—now we’ll wait!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I—I wish I knew what <i>for</i>!” whispered Pola.
The smell of rank bilge water, the lift and drop of
the boat sickened her. The wind was whining and
that and the swish of the water against the sides of
the boat terrified the girl.</p>

<p class='c008' >In a few short words Lav vouchsafed Pola a little
information. Like Sidney he admired the girl’s
gameness though he was beginning to wish they had
not let her come.</p>

<p class='c008' >“How long do you think we’ll have to wait? And
what if no one comes?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’ll have to wait until most morning anyway
before the tide is out. And if no one comes tonight
we’ll have to come out again, that’s all. We’re not
in this business for any fun!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh—h!” sighed Pola, clinging closer to
Sidney.</p>

<p class='c008' >The wind howled over their heads with increasing
velocity and Sidney thought involuntarily of the
snugness of Miss Letty’s buggy. Miss Letty was
probably almost to Truro now. And Aunt Achsa
thought she was with her!</p>

<p class='c008' >“Is—is the boat tied tight?” asked Pola; and Lav
assured her that it was. “The wind could get a
lot worse and you’d be as safe out here as in your
bed at home.”</p>

<p class='c008' >After a long while Mart muttered, “What’s
that?” The others leaned forward in the blackness
of the cabin. They had all felt rather than heard a
soft thud as though something had touched the side
of the boat. And in a few moments heavy footsteps
came straight toward the fo’castle.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, will they come <i>here</i>?” breathed Pola, shaking.
And for answer Sidney caught Pola’s arm with
a warning clutch.</p>

<p class='c008' >For an instant it seemed that the footsteps must
descend to the cabin. But at the companionway they
halted. A voice came, heavy and thick.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I tell you it ain’t safe to take it off now. They
got a man on Rockman’s and another on Teal’s and
no knowin’ how many in the bay! Every constable
on the Cape’s here, damn them! And old Davies’s
been ’round all day and he ain’t rigged up for any
picnic!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“If we don’t take it off tonight Lav Green may
find it—or that girl—”</p>

<p class='c008' >At that someone laughed, horribly. “Huh—<i>him</i>!
Why we could twist every crooked bone in
his body until he wouldn’t know ’em. Him—ha,
that’s a joke! Why, a look ’ud scare him to a pulp.
The girl, too.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney, reaching her hand out instinctively,
caught Lavender’s and held it tight. She felt the
writhing of his body.</p>

<p class='c008' >A new voice broke in above them. “I got a better
scheme. Listen. We’ll—” But the voices suddenly
died to silence; the footsteps moved away.</p>

<p class='c008' >The four, huddled in the darkness of the cabin,
drew long trembling breaths.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Lav, those diamonds are on this boat!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sh—h. I know it. But we got to be careful.
They haven’t gone yet. We got to wait. And we’ll
wait until we find ’em. Damn them <i>I’ll</i> show them
who’s crooked!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hush,” implored Sidney. “Of course you
will”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Isn’t it most morning? I—I wish I was home,”
quavered Pola; but no one paid any heed to her.</p>

<p class='c008' >With the howling of the wind, the slap-slap of
the water, it was difficult to make out whether the
men had left the boat or not. Once Lav crawled
to the top of the companion ladder but a muttering
like a human voice drove him back. Queer sounds
struck upon their sensitized ears. And the boat
seemed to lift to a new motion.</p>

<p class='c008' >They waited for an interminable time. Then
Mart spoke quickly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Lav, we’re moving!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Lav needed no warning. He, too, had missed the
pull of the boat on the anchor rope. He shot up
the ladder.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, what’s the matter?” cried Sidney and Pola,
forgetting all caution.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mart had no time to explain her fears. In an
instant Lav was back, fairly throwing himself into
the cabin.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’re drifting! They cut the anchor rope!
We’re drifting out! Fast! Way out! To sea!”</p>

<p class='c008' >That had been the “better scheme.” To cut
the <i>Arabella</i> free from its mooring and let the wind
and tide carry it out into the bay. At first Starrow
had not favored the plan; he had declared that it
was too much risk, that the wind was shifting and
freshening fast and that the old tub might open a
seam, but Joe Josephs had convinced him with: “the
<i>Arabella</i> would be good for a week out in a nastier
sea than this. It’s safer than riskin’ runnin’ afoul
one of Phin Davies’ men ashore. Guthrie’s <i>Sally</i>’ll
stand this squall and pick up the <i>Arabella</i> easy and
we can reckon sure on the course the old tub’ll take,
even ’lowin’ for the wind to shift.”</p>

<p class='c008' >As she comprehended what had happened Pola
screamed. Mart and Sidney dragged her with them
up the ladder. Lav was at the side of the boat tearing
off his blouse.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Lav, what’ll we do! What are you going
to do now?” cried Sidney.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s so black,” wailed Pola. “I’m—sick!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m going to swim ashore. It’s the only way.
I don’t know how long this old tub’ll stand a sea and
the wind’s rising. We got to get help.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You shan’t swim alone, Lavender Green. We’ll
<i>all</i> swim. That’s nothing of a swim—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“You can’t! You forget—Pola.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney wheeled in consternation. “Pola’s complex!”
The girl was crouched, now, on the deck,
an abject, wailing figure.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You go with Lav, Mart,” said Sidney in a
quiet voice. “I’ll stay with Pola.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What do you think I am? I guess I’ll stay
with her too!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But your grandmother—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, gran’ma!” Mart’s voice choked. “But she’d
be the one to <i>tell</i> me to stay—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s no use our all trying it,” muttered Lav.
“I’ll get there or I won’t get anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Maybe it’s too far for you to swim!” Sidney
was at Lavender’s side, her hands on his arm. The
boy’s form in its light underwear showed pitifully
crooked but Sidney saw him straight and she saw
the gleam in his eyes. Suddenly she remembered
what Vick had said so lightly about the Grail. Ah,
she was seeing its gleam now, transcendently beautiful,
in Lav’s eyes! She dropped her hold of his arm.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You see, I’ve <i>got</i> to try it, Sid.” And she
understood. He went on: “I’ll swim for the lighthouse.
They can telephone from there to Rockman’s.
You girls find a light and signal with it. Don’t lose
your nerve, Sid.” He poised for an instant on the
rail then plunged into the black water.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, <i>Lav</i>,” cried Sidney. She leaned far over
the side of the boat. She could see nothing but a
crest of foam. “Mart, he’s—he’s—drowned!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Pola screamed again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c006'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />“THERE’S SOMETHING WRONG!”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >In the sunny embrasure of Mrs. White’s morning
room Trude Romley sorted over the mail that
Pepper, the butler, had brought in. So gay and colorful
was the room itself with its cretonnes, its soft
tinted walls, its singing birds, in wicker cages, that
it seemed a part of the fragrant garden that crowded
close to the French windows. A tiny fountain
splashed azure blue water over delicately sculptured
nymphs; a flowering vine trailed around the windows.</p>

<p class='c008' >The mail arranged, Trude sat back in the cushions
of a great wicker chair and with a long breath
of delight enjoyed the beauty around her. Each day
Edgeacres enraptured her anew and roused in her a
wonder as to why it should be her lot to be there.
“It ought to be Vick or Issy,” she would apologize
to the nodding flowers or to Mitie, the yellow warbler.</p>

<p class='c008' >And as might be expected Trude had found
innumerable ways of making herself useful to Mrs.
White as an expression of her gratitude. There were
telephone calls she could answer, letters she could
write, shopping she could do, ordering, she even conferred
with old Pepper and Jonathan, the gardener.
She drove with Mrs. White in the afternoon and
served tea to the callers who flocked to the house
from the nearby summer hotels.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I do not know how I ever got along without
you, my dear,” Mrs. White had said more than
once. “What do you do to make yourself so invaluable?
It seems as though just to look at you one
leans on you! Even Pepper is saying ‘Miss Trude
thinks this and Miss Trude thinks that—’”</p>

<p class='c008' >Her benevolent interest in her husband’s wards,
a certain pride in saying to her friends: “My husband,
you know, is looking after the daughters of
Joseph Romley, who was a college friend of his,” had
grown into a real fondness for Trude. “I have
never appreciated the dear girl when she’s been with
us before,” she declared to her husband. “I suppose
it was because we were in town, then, and I was too
busy to get acquainted with her. Why, she’s really
pretty. And she makes such a slave of herself to her
sisters! She hasn’t any life of her own. I don’t believe
they appreciate it, either. It’s a shame she doesn’t
marry some nice young man—” Mrs. White’s kind
always found virtue’s reward in the proverbial “nice
young man.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Mr. White agreed with her on every point but
this. “If she deserted that household it would fall!
She’s the only one that isn’t like her father.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then she must find someone who’ll take the
family with her,” Mrs. White asserted determinedly.
But having no godmother’s fairy wand she had not
been able, during the summer weeks, to bring the
prince to Edgeacres; her husband’s acquaintances
were too bald and round to play the part of princes.</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude had not minded the dearth of young men.
Since her unhappy experience on a former visit she
was glad of that dearth. The serenity of the summer,
the relaxation and rest from responsibilities had
brought a lovely freshness to her face, a brightness
to her eyes that was not all a reflection of the brightness
about her. The sheer luxury of loafing, of not
having to think out petty problems or worry one
single minute was all her old-young heart now asked.
Once in awhile, of course, she fretted because Isolde
was not enjoying Edgeacres with her, or getting to
know how really nice Aunt Edith White was. Where
Vick and Sidney were concerned she had no remorse
for Vick was seeing new lands, doubtless conquering
them, and Sidney was happy at Cape Cod; but she
could not help thinking that Issy must be working
too hard at the Deerings—getting up early in the
morning and typing all through the hot day and doubtless
fussing over the housework and the small babies
as well.</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude thought of the mail. Again there had been
no letter from either Issy or Sidney! Sidney really
<i>ought</i> to write. Perhaps it <i>had</i> not been wise to let
her go off alone with relatives of whom they knew
nothing!</p>

<p class='c008' >Suddenly a postmark on one of the letters on the
little table at her elbow caught her eye.
Provincetown. Trude caught it up apprehensively. That
letter might be from their Cousin Achsa! She turned
it over and over, wishing she might open it.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Good morning, my dear! I get up with the birds
myself and find that you’re up before me!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude laughed, to cover her anxiety. “I told
Jonathan I’d inspect his new beds this morning.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“There, didn’t I say you were supplanting me
in Jonathan’s esteem? But he only wants you to
admire them and smile at him. He knows you
know nothing about gardens, even though you are a
very wise young woman! Ah, the mail—is there
anything there worth looking at before breakfast?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Two cards, three advertising envelopes and—and
two personal letters.” Trude held out the two
letters, her heart beating in her throat.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mrs. White glanced at them indifferently. She
turned one as though to tear open the envelope, then
stopped to play with Mitie. Next she gave her attention
to Pepper who appeared in the door to summon
her to breakfast. And all the time Trude’s eyes were
beseeching her to open them—to open <i>one</i> of them
quickly.</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude followed her into the breakfast room and
sat down across from her. After she had eaten
her fruit Mrs. White took up the envelope that was
postmarked Provincetown and studied it while Trude
waited.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, that’s from Laura Craig—a cousin of
mine. I remember now she said she was going to
study in a summer school on Cape Cod. I hope the
girl’s getting on. She’s dependent upon her own
labor.” As she spoke she spread out the sheet. A
sketch dropped to the table.</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude drew a long breath. She had not known
how worried she was. She wanted to laugh aloud
now from sheer relief. Because she had to do something
she took up the sketch with a murmured:
“May I?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Laura writes it’s a little sketch she made in
class. ‘This will show you I am improving. It’s
from life. It will give you an idea of the delightful
types we find around here, types that you will not
find anywhere else. These are two little vagabonds
whom you see almost anytime on the beach or around
the wharves—as wild and free and beautiful as the
seagulls—’”</p>

<p class='c008' >Mrs. White looked up from the letter to take
the sketch and exclaimed aloud at Trude’s face. It
had gone deathly white.</p>

<p class='c008' >“My <i>dear</i>, what is it?”</p>

<p class='c008' >For a moment Trude could not answer. She
was staring at the sketch as though she could not
take her eyes from it.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Read that again! These are types—you find
these girls any time on the wharves—wild—vagabonds!
Oh, Aunt Edith that’s—<i>that’s</i>—<i>Sidney</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, it <i>can’t</i> be, Trude. You said—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude shook her head. “I can’t help what I said.
It’s Sidney. I—know. The likeness is true—there
can’t be anyone else who looks like Sidney! But she’s
barefooted—and—and so—<i>slovenly</i>—and—<i>her hair</i>!
She’s cut her beautiful hair!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Mrs. White took the sketch forcibly from Trude.
She frowned over it. One of the girls certainly did
look like Sidney as she remembered the child from
their one meeting.</p>

<p class='c008' >“How do you explain it, Trude?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude sighed heavily. “I can’t explain it. There’s
something wrong somewhere. And it’s my fault,
Aunt Edith. I—I consented—we all consented to
let Sidney go off down there just so that we could
go ahead with our own plans. But we thought—we
felt <i>certain</i> that these cousins were very nice—I—I
mean had a lovely home and were rich so that Sidney
might get something out of her visit that she couldn’t
get at home. It sounds shameful to <i>say</i> it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I understand, my dear. But what made you
think so?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“The—the letter this Cousin Achsa wrote. It
<i>was</i> a very nice letter!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, <i>I</i> have always thought you could judge
anyone’s character and background by a letter. There
must be something wrong. This girl—” pointing to
the sketch, “is positively shocking! At least she
would be around here.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I remember now something Sidney said—when
she was begging us to let her go away. ‘I want to
be different! I want to go somewhere where I won’t
be Joseph Romley’s daughter. I want adventure and
to do exciting things—’ Those were her very words!
I didn’t take them seriously then, but, oh, Aunt
Edith, perhaps she meant them more than we
guessed!” Poor Trude rose quickly to her feet.
“Aunt Edith, I simply <i>must</i> go to Provincetown
at once. May I ask Pepper to find out about trains?
You’ll—you’ll understand, won’t you? I can’t be
happy one minute until I see the child. I feel that
it’s all my fault.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Mrs. White was all concern. She summoned
Pepper and instructed him to find out the first train;
she sent her maid to Trude’s room to pack her clothes.
And last she wrote a generous check.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You may need it, my dear. It is nothing. Don’t
thank me. I wish I could do more. Somehow your
shoulders seem too young to carry so much responsibility!”</p>

<p class='c008' >So on the selfsame day that Sidney and the
others set out upon their adventure Trude was journeying
to Cape Cod. She missed connections at
Boston and hired an automobile to take her to Provincetown,
in her heart thanking Mrs. White for the
check that made this possible. Two blow-outs delayed
her journey so that it was midnight when she
reached her destination. She could scarcely hunt
out the Greens and Sidney at that hour. She took a
room at the hotel for the night and sat for a
while at its window straining her eyes out into the
darkness. The howling of the wind intensified her
apprehension; somewhere out in that strange blackness
that enwrapped her was her little sister. Perhaps
Sidney needed her that very moment!</p>

<p class='c008' >Finally she crept into bed and fell into a troubled
sleep. She did not hear the running steps that passed
under her window or the muffled voices of excited
men.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />“WHAT THE NIGHT HELD”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“Oh—h, take me back to the cabin!” moaned
Pola.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I guess we might as well,” muttered Mart. Their
matches had been long since exhausted; they had
been of little avail for the one ship’s light on the boat
was without oil.</p>

<p class='c008' >One on each side of her, Mart and Sidney helped
Pola down into the cabin. The boat was rolling
heavily now in the rough sea, each lift and drop
sending terror to the three young hearts. In the
blackness of the night the waves looked mountain
high. Even Mart was glad to shut them from view.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If—if we’re going to drown I’d rather drown
in—a—room,” gasped Pola, clinging to Sidney and
burying her face in Sidney’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008' >It seemed to the girls as though months had
passed since Lav had plunged to what they felt certain
was his death. The <i>Arabella</i> had tossed about
on the roughening water like some wild thing, her
old timbers creaking and groaning under their new
living. Just at first Sidney and Mart had been too
concerned in quieting the panic-stricken Pola to face
their danger; not until Pola had exhausted herself
did they think of their possible fate.</p>

<p class='c008' >Unless Lav succeeded in reaching the beach and
giving an alarm, they might toss about for days or
be dashed to pieces on some reef. Or, worse fate,
Jed Starrow and his gang might find the boat and—</p>

<p class='c008' >“Wh-at are you thinking about, Mart?” whispered
Sidney after a long time of silence, broken only
by the howling of the wind and the pounding of
the water. “Let’s talk—and then we can’t hear—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t be afraid, Sidney,” Mart spoke calmly.
“You sort o’ belong to the Cape and we Cape folks
don’t think anything of drowning. We sort of expect
to, sometime—” But here her voice broke with a
tremble. “I—I was thinking of gran’ma. I wish
I’d been better to her. I talk back to her lots of
times when I shouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But you <i>are</i> good to her, Mart. And—<i>I</i> was
thinking of Aunt Achsa. I shouldn’t have deceived
her—about coming out here. I fooled myself into
thinking that even a lie didn’t matter considering
what we were trying to do. But the honor of Cape
Cod isn’t worth anything happening to Lav. And
if anything does happen there won’t be anyone to tell
about Jed Starrow, anyway! Oh, Mart, I can’t
bear to <i>think</i> about Lav. Why did we let him do
it? Dear old Lav. I’ve been mean to him, too.
He adores poetry and I—I never even told him that
my father was a poet and that I know lots and lots
of poems and—and—that I’ve written most a book
myself.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Honest, Sid, was your father a poet? And
you can write it yourself? Gee,” softly. “I wish
I could do something like that. I’d rather be like
that than anything else. I just pretend that I hate
school and books and such things—it’s because I
had to stop going to school to stay with gran’ma that
I’ve put on that I didn’t have any use for it. Even
when I was sort of laughing at you, Sid, down in my
heart I was feeling aw’fly proud that you’d want to
fool ’round with anyone like me—I’ll <i>always</i>
be proud.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Mart—” Sidney faltered. “I wish I could
put into words what Mr. Dugald taught me when I
first came here. That it’s the big inside things that
really count. He told me so’s I’d see Aunt Achsa
and Lav as they really are. And, Mart, your giving
up school to take care of your grandmother is a big
thing, a real thing! You don’t want to forget it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, I’m—I’m—sick!” broke in Pola.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sit up straight and talk and you won’t think
about it,” commanded Mart, so sternly that Pola
straightened, her white face wan in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t see how you <i>can</i> talk when you’re—may
be—going—to die!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, talking helps you more than crying.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But I—I don’t <i>want</i> to—die.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Who does?” retorted Mart roughly. Nevertheless,
touched by Pola’s helplessness, she found Pola’s
hand and held it close in hers. “But let’s face whatever
happens with our heads up!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“To the wind,” breathed Sidney, shivering.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I—I just can’t be brave like you two. I—I’m
an awful coward. I can’t help it. I’ve always been
afraid to even try to swim. I’m afraid of lots of
things. Oh, I’m afraid to—to—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney caught Pola’s other hand.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Don’t say it, Pola. Maybe someone will find
us. And probably you can’t help feeling afraid.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Mart suddenly remembered the cookies she had
brought. She found them where she had hidden them
at the back of one of the bunks.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Here, eat a cookie and you’ll forget things. I’m
hungry, aren’t you, too?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Pola ate with nervous greed. Sidney bit off a
piece but found it dry in her mouth. She was thinking
of her sisters and the safety of the dear old
house; as vividly as though it hung in a picture before
her eyes she saw the little circle around the dining
room table, the embroidered square of Indian cloth,
the green shaded lamp, Issy’s books and Trude’s sewing,
Vick’s sketching things, the girls at their beloved
tasks—and her chair empty! Oh, what if she never
sat again in that dear circle? Her heart broke in an
agony of longing for Trude.</p>

<p class='c008' >A sudden thought roused Pola to a feeble show
of spirit.</p>

<p class='c008' >“If I had known how to swim we’d all be ashore
now! And you two stayed with me! I—I don’t
believe I’m worth that, girls.” She spoke with
gloomy conviction.</p>

<p class='c008' >But Mart answered with a promptness that settled
that question forever. “Forget it. Why, you
don’t think we could a’ done anything else, do you?
And now I’m going up on deck and get some air.
We must be most to Halifax by this time.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Halifax!</i>” But this time Pola did not scream.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008' >Lavender, after his first plunge, had struck out
toward the lighthouse. His Mr. Dugald had taught
him the science of swimming and because it was the
one thing he could do easily and well, in spite of
his misshaped body, Lavender had taken pride in
perfecting the practice. His assurance helped him
now; he had no fear, he knew how to save his
strength; he swam first with one stroke, then with
another, always keeping in sight the beacon of light.</p>

<p class='c008' >But after a little it came to him that the yellow
gleam did not seem any closer; in fact, it grew fainter;
he knew then, with a moment’s panic, that the tide
and wind were too strong for him. He cursed his
frail strength, with a smarting in his eyes that did
not come from the salt water.</p>

<p class='c008' >There was only one thing he could do. Turn his
back on the friendly light and strike out in the direction
of the beach. It would be further, but the cross
currents of the tide would not impede his progress
so much.</p>

<p class='c008' >For a long time he fought ahead stubbornly,
changing his strokes, even swimming on his back.
But his breath came with increasing difficulty, a sharp
pain stabbed at his side. He labored on. The pain
grew sharper and caught at him like a horrible vise.
Once he yielded to it and sank down, down into the
black water. But it passed and, as he rose, he struck
out again, blindly, now, for he had lost all sense of
direction.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, God! Oh, God!” he shouted in his heart.
His Aunt Achsa’s God, whose All-embracing Love
he had questioned because that God had made him
crooked, must help him now! “I <i>got</i> to get help!”
God <i>must</i> hear him.</p>

<p class='c008' >A great exhaustion seized him. He sank again
with a quivering breath. But now his feet touched
sand. With new strength he plunged ahead. Again
he was in deep water but he swam with eager strokes.
The dreadful pain stabbed but he did not heed. Now
he saw moving lights. He was near the beach! With
a heartbreaking effort he fought the strength of the
water, finally gaining the shallow depths. He heard
voices nearby in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c008' >Knee-deep in the water he tried to shout but he
had no strength. A terrible faintness was creeping
over him. His arms outstretched, he stumbled forward
toward the voices. Oh, he must <i>not</i> yield to
that overpowering sleepiness until he had made them
know!</p>

<p class='c008' >“Help—help!” he gasped, reeling toward the
shadowy forms.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What the blazes—” A man ran forward. Two
others came at his heels.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, <i>it’s Lav Green</i>!” one of them cried.</p>

<p class='c008' >“The <i>Arabella</i>—adrift out there—Sidney’s on
it—oh—<i>help</i>! And then Lavender slipped into the
strong arms that reached out to catch him.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Quick, the <i>Sally</i>! She’s at Rockman’s!” Captain
Davies ran toward Rockman’s wharf. Before
Jed Starrow’s men, concealed behind the shed could
guess their intention, three men had jumped into
the big motor boat and had swung her free of the
wharf.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What the hell—” shouted an ugly voice after
them, but the <i>Sally</i> only chugged out into the darkness
of the bay.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008' >“Look, Sid—light! It’s—it’s—morning!”
Mart’s voice came in a thin whisper. For a long time
the girls had lain huddled against the taff-rail of the
boat, too weary and disheartened to even talk.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney lifted her face to the tiny streak of light
that gleamed palely in the east.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then she shook Pola ever so slightly. Poor Pola
had fallen into a sleep of exhaustion. She stirred
now with a little cry. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’s morning—daylight. See—there—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh—h!” Pola whimpered. “Is that all?” She
clung to Sidney in fresh terror. “If we’re going to
die—I’d rather not <i>see</i>—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hark,” cried Mart, suddenly leaning forward.
“Don’t you hear something? Girls, that’s a motor
boat! I <i>know</i>! Quick. Let’s signal! Yell! Wave
something! <i>Anything!</i>” She sprang to her feet,
leaning her body against the rail for support as the
boat rolled in the heavy sea. She cupped her hands
to her lips and shouted lustily. “Come on, girls!”
she commanded.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Maybe it’s the pirates,” wailed Pola.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I don’t care if it is! I don’t care <i>what</i> it is!”
And Mart and Sidney lifted their chorus.</p>

<p class='c008' >Out of the mist that lay over the surging water
a small, gray object gradually shaped. The chug-chug
of an engine now came distinctly to their ears.
After a little they could make out the forms of two
men standing. And then someone shouted faintly.</p>

<p class='c008' >Pola, a solemn happiness transfiguring her face,
clung to Sidney.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Girls,” she whispered, “We’re going to be
saved! And I’ll never forget this night—never. Or
you two. Or what you’ve done! Or what you <i>are</i>.
And I’m never going to get over being ashamed of
myself!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney had some solemn resolutions of her own
shaping in her heart but the moment gave her no
time to pronounce them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Mart!” she cried. “It’s <i>not</i> Jed Starrow!
It’s—it’s—Cap’n Phin Davies! And that means that—<i>Lav</i>—<i>made</i>—<i>it</i>!”
And happy tears ran down
her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c008' >Under the skilled guidance of the man at its
wheel the <i>Sally</i> soon came alongside of the <i>Arabella</i>.
Cap’n Davies promptly boarded the schooner and
the next instant Sidney was in his arms.</p>

<p class='c008' >“All I’ll say is praise be to God!” the old mariner
muttered. “And now I cal’late you and your mates
here are ’bout ready to abandon your cruisin’—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Lav, is he—all right?” demanded Sidney, still
clinging to Cap’n Phin.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, he jest about made port and how he is
now I can’t say for I didn’t waste any time shippin’
in the <i>Sally</i>. Lucky for us it was lyin’ there at Rockman’s.
Give us a hand, Saunders, while we load on
this cargo of distress!” A roughness in the old man’s
voice betrayed that the big heart was not as light
as he would have the girls think. For hours they had
searched the bay with only their knowledge of tides
and winds to guide them; more than once the others
had been ready to abandon the search as futile, but
the Captain had held them stubbornly to it.</p>

<p class='c008' >Pola needed no urging but leaped into the <i>Sally</i>
and sank to its bottom with a long gasp of relief.
Sidney and Mart were about to follow her example
when a word from Cap’n Davies held Sidney.</p>

<p class='c008' >“We’ll let a government boat pick up the <i>Arabella</i>.
We’ll take no chances tryin’ to tow her in
with the <i>Sally</i>.” And then Sidney thought of the
treasure.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But the diamonds!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Diamonds</i>—” Cap’n Davies stared at her, his
mouth open.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, yes, they’re on this boat. They <i>must</i>
be! We were in the forward cabin watching and Jed
Starrow came on board and they talked right where
we could hear. They were going to take them off
and then they decided it wasn’t safe and they’d wait
and they went away. And then they must have cut
the boat adrift. But we’re <i>sure</i> they’re on this boat.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“So that was it! Of all the low-down dastardly
tricks! Well, never mind your diamonds, now. We
got to get back to shore and let a few folks know—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“But I won’t <i>go</i> until we’ve looked!” Sidney protested,
almost in tears. “Why, that was why we
risked everything! And Lav wants to save the name
of the Cape—the—the way—you do! Oh, please
look!”</p>

<p class='c008' >The old Captain dropped his hold of the girl’s
arm. “Well, I’ll be ding-blasted!” he stormed. But
he motioned to Saunders. “Climb aboard and give
us a hand. ’Taint likely they’d hide their stuff above
deck. You look round the stern and the girls and
me’ll give a hunt forward. Of all the stubborn,
crazy-headed female pieces you’ll beat ’em all!”</p>

<p class='c008' >While Saunders searched the stern of the schooner
the Captain and Sidney and Mart searched the fo’castle
cabin. Sidney, tugging away the heavy tarpaulins,
disclosed a small wooden box.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m <i>sure</i> it wasn’t there before—” she cried.
“Why—why, I was <i>sitting</i> on it—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Cap’n Davies lifted the box. “It’s pretty big
to be diamonds but it looks suspicious like! And
you’re sure it wasn’t there before? That it ain’t the
property of that summer boarder of Miss Green’s?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney’s face was flaming with excitement. “Oh,
I’m <i>sure</i>! The other stuff was there but there wasn’t
any box under it. If I hadn’t been so excited listening
I’d have realized I was sitting on something different.
Can’t we look inside?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“We won’t take the time to look at anything now,
mate. We’ll get ashore. I reckon by this time there
are folks strainin’ their eyes for a sight o’ you—”</p>

<p class='c008' >He fairly pushed Sidney and Mart ahead of him
and toward the <i>Sally</i>. Saunders lifted the girls into
the smaller boat, then took the box.</p>

<p class='c008' >“To Rockman’s. Quick as you can make it,”
snapped Cap’n Phin.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />“YOU NEED A BIG BROTHER”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Aunt Achsa had not slept through the storm.
Accustomed though she was to the howl of the wind
and the roar of the pounding surf, tonight it filled
her heart with dread. Lavender had not come home.</p>

<p class='c008' >Twice during the night hours she crept to the
door of his small room and peered in, shielding her
candle with a trembling hand. For a long while she
sat in the window straining her eyes into the darkness.
The cats came and rubbed her bare ankles and
Nip meowed plaintively. She picked him up and cuddled
him to her.</p>

<p class='c008' >Suddenly a moving object in the lane caught her
attention. It separated itself into the forms of men,
men moving slowly as though they bore a burden.
They turned into the garden patch.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Lavender!” Aunt Achsa cried, jumping up
quickly, shaking. “Oh—my boy!”</p>

<p class='c008' >But that was the only sound she made. She
opened the door as though she had been waiting
for these men with their limp burden. She directed
them to carry the boy to his own room. She moved
aside for Doctor Blackwell who had come with the
others, an old pair of flannel trousers drawn over
his night shirt. She felt Mr. Dugald put a
restraining arm over her shoulders and nodded as though to
say: “I’m all right—just look out for Lavender.”</p>

<p class='c008' >One of the men coming back from Lavender’s
room offered an explanation. “Those young ’uns
were on the <i>Arabella</i> and it broke from its moorin’s.
The boy swum ashore to give an alarm. Plucky,
I say—don’t know how he did it.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Those young ones—<i>who</i>?” cried Dugald Allan.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, I cal’late that gal Sidney and I don’t know
who else—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sidney went with Miss Vine!” protested Achsa.</p>

<p class='c008' >But at that moment Miss Letty appeared in the
door, as scantily clad as the doctor had been. From
her window which faced Doctor Blackwell’s house,
she had heard the men summoning him. She had
lost no time in getting to Sunset Lane.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Who went with me? Where? What’s happened?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Now Aunt Achsa let her whole weight drop
against Mr. Dugald.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Didn’t Sidney go ’long to Truro with you?”
she asked falteringly.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I didn’t go to Truro. Knew this storm was
comin’. Where—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh—h!” Aunt Achsa moaned Mr. Dugald
motioned to Miss Vine.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Take care of things—here. I’m off—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Cap’n Davies and Jim Saunders and Pete Cady’s
gone out in the <i>Sally</i>,” cried one of the men who
had brought Lavender home. But Dugald Allan
had plunged into the darkness without hearing him.
The men rushed after him.</p>

<p class='c008' >Miss Vine pushed Aunt Achsa into a chair.</p>

<p class='c008' >“You’re not going to cross any bridges ’til you
come to them, Achsy Green. Doctor Blackwell
brought Lav into this world and he isn’t going to
let him quit it without putting up a pretty good fight.
Jeremiah Berry’s in with him and he’s as good as
two women. You wrap that shawl ’round you ’til I
can light a lamp and get you some clothes. You’re
shivering like it was December. I’ll put the kettle
over, too—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Oddly huge and gaunt in the shadowy room, Miss
Vine moved and talked briskly to keep up Aunt
Achsa’s nerve and her own against the black fear
that held them.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mr. Dugald ran with all speed to Rockman’s, the
other men after him. As their hurrying steps echoed
through the silent street heads popped out of windows,
doors opened. Then more men, half-dressed and
dressing as they ran, rushed after them toward Rockman’s.
They knew, with that intuition inbred in seacoast
communities, that something was wrong. Old
Simon Tibbetts, too crippled to join the gathering
crowds, rang up Commander Nelson at the Life
Guard station on the backside.</p>

<p class='c008' >When, in the gray light of the dawn, the <i>Sally</i>
chugged up to Rockman’s wharf with its precious
cargo Sidney and Mart found a weary, anxious crowd
of men and women gathered there. And as Cap’n
Davies and Saunders lifted the girls ashore a lusty
shout of rejoicing went up—eager hands reached
out to touch the rescued as though to make certain
they were safe and sound.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney had eyes only for Mr. Dugald who seemed
to tower above them all, his eyes dark lined with the
strain of anxious watching, his mouth set sternly.
And strangely enough, at first, Dugald Allan saw
only Sidney, yet it was not strange, for the white-faced,
shrinking, abject girl, barefooted and disheveled,
who was hiding behind Mart and Sidney, had
little semblance to his gay young cousin.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mr. Dugald opened his arms and Sidney ran
into them like a little child, and clung to him. He
felt her slender body shaking.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I—I can’t help crying. I wanted Trude—so
much!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>I</i> was thinking of Trude, too. Thank God!”
But Sidney was too moved at the moment to wonder
at his words or that the cheek he bent to hers was
wet with tears.</p>

<p class='c008' >Then Dugald Allan spied Pola shivering forlornly
behind Mart and Sidney. “<i>You</i>—” he cried,
pushing Sidney aside. “I thought you were at Chatham!”
His mouth tightened in a straight, stern line.
“What is all this? But wait, I must get Sidney back
to Aunt Achsa. You shall explain things as we go
along.”</p>

<p class='c008' >He hurried the girls through the crowd which
parted, smilingly, to let them pass. On Commercial
Street he hailed old Hiram Moss, who with an eye
to business in the midst of tragedy, had harnessed
his horses to his ancient cab and had them ready for
an emergency.</p>

<p class='c008' >After he had bundled his charges in Dugald Allan
turned to Sidney.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Now give me some inkling of what started this
crazy adventure. Thank God it has not ended as it
might have ended though Lavender is still fighting
for his life! Answer me, Sidney.”</p>

<p class='c008' >But before Sidney could begin her tale she had
to know what had happened to Lavender.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Fighting for his life? But—he <i>got here</i>, didn’t
he?”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes—he reached shore, by an effort so great
as to completely prostrate him. They took him home.
I left Doctor Blackwell with him.” Dugald Allan
spoke shortly and his crisp sentences had the effect of
stunning poor Sidney. She shivered and leaned close
to him. Her voice, when she spoke, came with a
childish tremor.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Lavender <i>can’t</i> die. If he does—it will be
all my fault! I started everything. I—I told him
about the diamonds—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Diamonds</i>—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Yes—the diamonds. That’s why we went out
on the <i>Arabella</i>—” In broken sentences Sidney told
the story; she wanted Mr. Dugald to know that they
had cared most for the honor of Cape Cod!</p>

<p class='c008' >“And we found them—a big box—at least we
<i>think</i> it’s the diamonds! Cap’n Phin Davies says
it’s <i>something</i> queer!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Dugald Allan’s exclamation had much the character
of an explosion. “<i>Diamonds!</i> What nonsense!
You’ve risked bereaving three homes for what is
probably nothing more than a case of rum. If ever
a girl needed a big brother to keep her in check,
you do!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />DIAMONDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >During the early morning hours of that summer
day that Sidney was destined never to forget, the
girl passed through every emotion that a fifteen-year-old
heart can suffer.</p>

<p class='c008' >First, to her dismay no one at the cottage had
seemed to rejoice, as the crowd on the wharf had
rejoiced, at her rescue. When Mr. Dugald led her
in Miss Vine was making coffee at the stove and all
she said was: “Well, you’re all right! Better go
to bed now as quick as you can and keep out from
under foot.” Then Mr. Dugald had taken Pola back
to the hotel. Aunt Achsa was with Doctor Blackwell
and Lavender. Sidney had tried to summon sufficient
courage to ask Miss Vine’s forbidding back for some
word of Lavender, but the words failed in her throat.
Cold, forlorn, hungry, she crept to her room, threw
off her clothes and huddled down into the bed-clothes.</p>

<p class='c008' >They would all blame her—Miss Vine and Mr.
Dugald, Aunt Achsa, Doctor Blackwell. Probably
now Pola would have more complexes to suffer;
Pola’s mother would be angry and they could never be
friends again. And Mart—Aunt Achsa had said old
Mrs. Calkins could be terrible when she was “worked
up!” Even if Lavender lived Aunt Achsa would
never forgive her and if he <i>didn’t</i> live—Mr. Dugald
had said he was fighting. Those boards creaking
faintly meant that Doctor Blackwell and Aunt Achsa
were helping Lavender fight. Dear old Lav with his
fine dreams!</p>

<p class='c008' >The desperate longing for Trude shook her. She
sobbed into her pillow. And yet the longing brought
only added remorse. Trude would scold her. Trude
would take her home. That meant stinging humiliation.
How Vick would laugh at her when everything
was over. A case of rum! Sidney writhed under
the soft covers.</p>

<p class='c008' >Somewhere boards creaked again—Lavender’s
fight. Sidney pictured the doctor and Aunt Achsa
bending over him. And outside everything was so
quiet and gray. That was the way death probably
came, Sidney thought.</p>

<p class='c008' >On the morrow they would send her home—in
disgrace. She might not even be allowed to see Lavender,
or Mart, or Pola—or Mr. Dugald. Someone
would telegraph to Trude and Trude would meet her
back at Middletown. She would live a long, sad life
of penance behind the crumbing stone wall she had
so detested.</p>

<p class='c008' >But the thought of the wall and the shelter of the
old house brought such a surcease of torment that
the girl had fallen into a heavy sleep. When she
wakened it was to a consciousness of bright
sunshine—and someone looking at her, someone different, and
someone smiling.</p>

<p class='c008' >She sat bolt upright and rubbed her eyes. Then
she flung out her arms with a low glad cry that was
half sob.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Trude—<i>Oh, Trude!</i>”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude held her long and close, stroking the shorn
head, murmuring soothing words. Finally Sidney
wriggled from her.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Have you come to take me home? But how
could they send for you so quickly? How long have
I been asleep? Oh, Lavender—is he—is he—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“One question at a time, Sid. Lavender is better.
He’ll be all right, the doctor says, after a good
rest. Yes, I think I’d better take you home. No,
they did not send for me.” Briefly, as though now
that earlier concern was of little consequence, Trude
told of the sketch that had so bewildered and alarmed
her.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I couldn’t understand,” she finished.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I couldn’t either, at first. You see the boarder—the
man who has boarded here so long and is
dreadfully fond of Aunt Achsa wrote that letter to
me and wrote it <i>nice</i> so as to please her, and, at first—but,
oh, Trude, Aunt Achsa <i>is</i> wonderful and so is
Lavender, really, truly, even though they are poor—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Hush, Sidney.” Trude’s eyes darkened with
feeling. “You do not have to tell me that. I have
learned <i>that</i> in only a few hours. Oh, I have seen
straight into souls—those kind men on the street, as
concerned as though you belonged to them, and
here—Aunt Achsa with her great courage and her
love. And that Miss Vine—they’re so <i>simple</i>—and
so fine—it made me ashamed of my silly standards,
my fears.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“And Lavender is best of all—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Now quick tears shone like stars in Trude Romley’s
eyes. She reached out her hands and caught
Sidney’s.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Lavender—when I think what <i>he</i> did I—I—”
She could not finish, but Sidney understood
the gratitude that was in her heart. She leaned her
face against Trude’s shoulder with a long sigh.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m cured of lots of things, Trude. I wanted
something different but I didn’t want all <i>this</i> to happen!
You see I <i>made</i> Lavender and Mart believe it
was diamonds Jed Starrow was hiding when it was
probably only a case of rum—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Suddenly Trude straightened. “I almost forgot.
A boy came here and said a Captain Davies
wanted you to come down to Rockman’s wharf as
soon as you could. That was two hours ago. You
see it is nearly noon now. You’d better dress quickly
and I’ll go out and fix you some breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney obeyed reluctantly. In her mingled remorse
and humiliation she shrank from facing the
world. She was not even curious as to why Cap’n
Phin wanted to see her.</p>

<p class='c008' >By the time she had dressed Trude had a poached
egg and a glass of milk ready for her. Miss Letty
was with Lavender and Aunt Achsa had gone to bed.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney begged so hard that Trude accompany
her to Rockman’s that Trude put on her hat and
went with her. And poor Sidney needed Trude’s
support for Sunset Lane was thronged with curious
men and women; as they walked along the waterfront
fishermen and tourists and boys and girls stared
and nodded and Sidney’s sensitive soul mistook their
obvious interest for ridicule. She walked with
lowered eyes lest she encounter Mrs. Calkins or
Pola’s mother.</p>

<p class='c008' >Cap’n Phin was waiting outside the door of the
shed on Rockman’s wharf. He nodded to Sidney
and Trude and beckoned them inside. At any other
time, in any other state of mind, Sidney would have
thrilled to his air of mystery.</p>

<p class='c008' >Four men sat in wooden chairs tipped at various
angles and on the floor before them stood the
wooden box from the <i>Arabella</i>. The men nodded
and smiled at Sidney and brought their chairs to the
floor as though to attention.</p>

<p class='c008' >Cap’n Davies solemnly motioned Sidney and
Trude to two vacant chairs and then cleared his
throat.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I cal’late, Miss Sidney, that you’ve a sort o’
interest in this cargo we brought in on the <i>Sally</i> so we
stood by ’til you hove in sight. Now, mebbe it’s what
we think it is and mebbe it isn’t. Si, give a hand
and unload.”</p>

<p class='c008' >One of the men knelt down by the box and proceeded
to open it with a hammer and a chisel. The
others leaned forward with interest. Sidney held
her breath.</p>

<p class='c008' >The man Si, having torn off the cover, put his
hands into the paper wrappings and drew forth
yards and yards of magnificently embroidered fabric
that made Sidney and Trude gasp in admiration and
astonishment. But the others were plainly disappointed.
A low murmur of disgust went around
the room.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Give it here,” one of the men asked. And as
Si handed over the contraband it slipped from his
hands. He caught at it quickly to save it from the
dirt of the floor. Suddenly something small and
gleaming fell from the folds and rolled upon the
floor.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’ll be ding-blasted!” roared Cap’n Phin. Someone
swore softly. The man Si dropped to his knees.
Sidney blinked.</p>

<p class='c008' >Cap’n Phin seized the silk and unwound it. And
among the countless folds he found a cunningly contrived
pocket filled with hundreds of the priceless
gems.</p>

<p class='c008' >For a moment no one spoke. The daring of it
all, the wealth of the glistening jewels, held each man
in the room. Cap’n Phin folded the gorgeous silk
and passed it to one of the men.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I guess this belongs to you in trust for Uncle
Sam,” he said gravely. “Our business is with one
Jed Starrow.” He turned to Sidney who was
trembling violently. “Now, matie, will you tell these
men how you happened to ship aboard the <i>Arabella</i>
last night?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney’s story tumbled out in quick, eager words
and in careful detail. The men listened closely. The
one who had taken the diamonds “in trust for Uncle
Sam” made notes in a small black book. When she
had finished Cap’n Phin nodded, his face serious.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Reckon we’d better not question Lav Green
just yet, he’s pullin’ out of the fog. We got enough
as ’tis to hold Jed Starrow. If I ain’t much mistaken
he’ll turn yellow when we face him and squeal on
the folks higher up what’s paid him to hurt the name
of the Cape. That’ll do for now, little gal.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Walking homeward Sidney could not speak for
excitement. It had <i>not</i> been rum! It <i>had</i> been the
diamonds they had sought! Their recklessness had
not been in vain. Her disgrace had a sweeter flavor.</p>

<p class='c008' >As they turned in to Sunset Lane Sidney spied
Mr. Dugald ahead. He must hear the news! And
he could tell her of Pola! She ran toward him,
calling. At the sound of her voice he lifted his head.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Mr. Dugald, it <i>was</i> diamonds—in that box,
you know, why—” But here Sidney stopped. For
Mr. Dugald was not even hearing her, he was staring
over her head at Trude.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, I forgot—this is my sister, Trude. Trude,
this is Mr. Dugald, Aunt Achsa’s—”</p>

<p class='c008' >But her introduction went no farther. At sight
of Trude’s face she broke off abruptly. And Mr.
Dugald was saying quietly:</p>

<p class='c008' >“I know your sister, Sidney. Trude, I am more
glad to see you than you can ever know!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney’s brain whirled. Mr. Dugald <i>knew</i>
Trude! And Trude—only once before had she seen
that look on Trude’s face and that had been when
she had watched Trude reading a letter to Issy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why—why—why—” she gasped, a great enlightenment
slowly dawning over her. “You’re—you’re—why,
you’re Trude’s <i>lost love</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Sidney!</i>” cried Trude, scarlet-faced.</p>

<p class='c008' >Dugald Allan laughed. “Sidney, go in and see
Lav. He’s been calling for you and Miss Letty says
you can see him for five minutes if you won’t let him
do any of the talking. I want to tell your sister
a few things about you that I think she ought to
know.” He caught Trude’s arm in a masterful way,
wheeled her about and led her down the lane.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney stared after them; even the excitement of
the diamonds faded to nothing by the side of this
amazing revelation. Mr. Dugald had known Trude
all the time! He was the man who had made Trude
so unhappy! He had let her talk of Trude and had
never betrayed by so much as a blush their
acquaintance!</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney had no choice but to go on alone to the
cottage. Her elation and her delight at seeing Lavender
were shadowed by a growing apprehension.
Mr. Dugald had promised to forget what she had told
him of Trude’s broken heart, but perhaps he hadn’t!
And he might tell Trude that he knew!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />WHAT THE DAY HELD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >“Dear Dorothea, again I stand at the crossroads,
a saddened soul, and wiser—”</p>

<p class='c008' >But Sidney could get no further than that. There
was so much to tell Dorothea that she did not know
how to begin. For those terrible hours on the <i>Arabella</i>
she had no words; she shrank from trying to
depict Lavender’s splendid courage for his white face
as she had seen it in the precious five minutes still
haunted her. Even the diamonds lost their lustre
beside Trude’s ultimatum that they must go home.</p>

<p class='c008' >Go home so ingloriously!</p>

<p class='c008' >It was two hours since Dugald had led Trude
away down the lane and Sidney’s apprehension had
mounted as the time had passed. She was feeling
very young and very forgotten; Miss Letty who
had remained at the cottage to “be handy” and to
answer the stream of inquiries that came to the door,
had warned her to “keep quiet” as there had been
enough excitement for one day and she had been too
rebuffed to even confide to Miss Letty that Mr.
Dugald was someone her sister had known a few
years before and that they had gone away without
her.</p>

<p class='c008' >Miss Letty was baking vigorously, her great hands
moving deftly among the cupboards, her straight
back eloquently expressive of her mood. “I guess
folks’ll have a different opinion of Lavender Green
<i>now</i>,” she muttered and as Sidney was the only person
within hearing she accepted the remark as
addressed to her and agreed. Miss Letty went on,
shaking the flour-sifter as though she wished she
were shaking someone in particular: “I guess folks
like that Mrs. Allan will have a different opinion of
Cape Cod. She came here and asked to see Lavender
and I took her in and waited outside the door—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, what did she say?” begged Sidney.</p>

<p class='c008' >“She offered him money! Well, I thought the
boy’d have a relapse on the spot. And I walked in
and took her by the arm and led her out and I said to
her: ‘Madam, we on Cape Cod do not sell our
bravery—we <i>give</i> it!’ I said just that. And she
withered like a limp leaf. She sort of clung to me and
cried like a baby. Yes, she’ll know now what sort o’
breed we Cape Coders are.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Even that Sidney could not record in Dorothea.</p>

<p class='c008' >She began to pack because it was the occupation
best suited to her mood and because from the window
of her room she could see Trude and Mr. Dugald the
moment they turned the corner by Mart’s house. She
spread her scant belongings over the bed and set the
old satchel on the rush-bottomed chair. She was in
the act of folding the precious cherry crêpe de chine
when she spied approaching figures—Trude and Mr.
Dugald, walking slowly. Her heart gave a quick
bound only to grow cold at the sight of Trude’s chin
which was set stubbornly in a way that Sidney well
knew! Nor did Mr. Dugald appear the happy lover;
he walked with bent face and occasionally kicked
at the flowers that edged the lane.</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude sought Sidney directly and nodded with
approval when she saw the packing. She sat down
on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sid,” she began in a queer voice that Sidney
had never heard before. “I suppose I ought to tell
you how I happened to know—Dugald Allan.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude spoke so slowly and with such difficulty
that Sidney hastened to make it easier for her.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I do know. You met him at the Whites three
winters ago and he wrote something. I overheard
you and Issy talking once but I didn’t hear his name
and I saw you crying over a letter—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude laughed shakily.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sidney, you’re simply the limit! Yes, I met
him there that first winter I went to visit Aunt Edith.
His father and Mr. White are old friends and he
was staying at Aunt Edith’s while he painted a portrait
of one of Aunt Edith’s friends. I was just a
silly, countrified girl and—I didn’t understand lots
of things and thought—well, there’s no use, now
going into all that. I lost my head and let myself
think things that weren’t so—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney interrupted, impatiently. “Trude, you
talk to me as though I was a baby and couldn’t hear
the truth. I guess I know; you fell in love with Mr.
Dugald and you thought he was in love with you—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Thank you, Sid. Yes, I <i>had</i> forgotten your
extreme age. I fell in love with—him. I am not
ashamed to admit it. I had never known anyone
like him before. And I thought—yes, that—There
was another girl there, Sylvia Thorn, from Atlanta.
She was very pretty and she and Dugald were great
pals and one day Aunt Edith told me she hoped
they would marry, that it would be a very nice match
for Dugald, a relief to his family, that he needed
that type of girl to cure him of his queer ways. I
remember just what she said. ‘You understand, my
dear, <i>you</i> have lived with genius yourself.’ It wasn’t
exactly <i>what</i> she said, it was the way she said it, as
though she thought I would know because <i>I</i> lived
entirely out of Dugald Allan’s class. It hurt cruelly.
It made me sensitive and made me see little things
between Dugald—and Sylvia. And it made me see
myself as someone quite unworthy of—Dugald. I
found some pretext to go home. I thought by running
away from it all I could forget. Dugald wrote
a few times—then that letter telling me that he was
going on a six months’ painting cruise in the South
Seas with Sylvia Thorn and her father and mother
and wanted to run up to Middletown to tell me
something before he went. I wrote back that he must
not come that I—could not—see him. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney was listening with clasped hands, a color
on her cheeks that matched Trude’s, stars in her
eyes. With magic swiftness her romantic soul was
piecing together a beautiful picture.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Why, that <i>can’t</i> be all! How could you have
written to him like that! And he wasn’t in love with
that Sylvia, was he?”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude’s eyes softened. “N—no. I know now.
He told me—today. Sylvia was engaged at the time
to his best friend, but they wanted it kept secret for
awhile. Dugald thought I knew.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Then—then—” cried Sidney. But, somehow,
she could not ask Trude what had happened during
the afternoon, something new in Trude’s dear eyes
plainly warned her that just now all that was too
much her own to be shared with anyone.</p>

<p class='c008' >Instead she threw her arms around Trude and
hugged her violently.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Trude, how I love you! And it’s so good
to be with you. Out there—on the boat—I kept
thinking of you and how safe I always feel with
you—how I <i>need</i> you! I don’t ever want to feel
grown-up again and independent, I don’t care <i>how</i>
old I am—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude kissed the tousled head. “You’ve said
just what I wanted to hear, dear,” she answered
softly. “And that you—need me!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Summoning them to supper, Miss Letty stood
with arms akimbo and with a satisfied eye surveyed
the good things she had prepared. That Mr. Dugald
was at the hotel starting his aunt and cousin homeward
from Provincetown, was Miss Letty’s one
regret. Sidney sniffed rapturously at everything,
begging that Trude sit next to her. The old kitchen
gleamed golden in the fading sunlight, a fragrance
of flowers and sea-air and pines came on the breeze
that wafted in through the wide-opened doors and
windows. Aunt Achsa, her smiling self again, fluttered
around in anxious concern as to Trude’s welfare.
A great happiness held the little group. Though Lavender’s
chair was empty Lavender was better—Lavender
would get well!</p>

<p class='c008' >After supper, while they still lingered over the
empty plates, the voices of men came from the lane.</p>

<p class='c008' >“More folks askin’ after Lav,” declared Miss
Letty with pride.</p>

<p class='c008' >Cap’n Davies himself halted before the door and
nodded to the women inside. Back of him stood
the men Sidney had met that morning at Rockman’s
and back of them Mr. Dugald, smiling, and back of
him many others, curious and excited. What <i>ever</i>
had happened!</p>

<p class='c008' >Cap’n Davies wore his most important air.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I’m here to see one Lavender Green and one
Sidney Romley.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Phin Davies, you know Lav Green’s flat on his
back,” retorted Miss Letty brusquely but smiling.
It seemed to Sidney, standing close to Trude, that
everyone was smiling.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mr. Dugald pushed into the room.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Doctor Blackwell says that it won’t hurt Lav
for me to carry him in!” And without another
word he rushed off to Lav’s room and returned almost
instantly with the boy in his arms. He put
him carefully in Aunt Achsa’s rocker and then stood
close to him.</p>

<p class='c008' >Cap’n Phin cleared his throat an extra number
of times. Having done this to his satisfaction he
drew a blue slip of paper from a leather pocketbook
and held it high.</p>

<p class='c008' >“In the name of Truro and Wellfleet counties
I take great pleasure in presenting to Lavender Green
and Sidney Romley this reward for the capture of—”</p>

<p class='c008' >He never did finish his speech. His voice was
drowned in loud hurrahs that echoed and reechoed
down the lane and brought Gran’ma Calkins and Mart
and Tillie Higgins in a great hurry to Achsa Green’s.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney’s face flamed.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, <i>I</i> don’t want it!” she cried. “It’s Lav’s.
Honestly. He really found out about the diamonds.
I—I just—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Everyone looked at Lavender, whose face had
gone even whiter. Against it his eyes shone big
and black. He seemed to straighten in the old chair
and his poor shoulders took on a fine dignity.</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>I</i>—didn’t—want—any—money,” he answered
in a voice so weak that it was scarcely anything more
than a whisper.</p>

<p class='c008' >But here the practical Miss Letty, who had taught
Mrs. Allan her lesson on Cape Cod folks, took charge
of matters.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Well, you can do a whole lot with money, Lav
Green. As long as the two counties decided it was
worth that much to run down these smugglers I
reckon you’ve earned it. And I want you men to
go away from here and spread the word over the
whole of Cape Cod that in that crooked body of
Lav Green’s is a heart that’s as brave as the bravest
and ambition, too. Folks have gotten to think he’s
a loafer because he wouldn’t go to school, but they’ll
come to know he isn’t and you can tell them Letty
Vine knows for she’s taught him herself and he
knows as much and more than any boy his age!
And now—well, you <i>watch</i> Lav Green! That’s all
I can say. Some day you men will hear about him
and remember this day and be awful proud!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Miss Vine had to stop to swallow something in
her throat. Cap’n Phin forgot entirely the nice
phrases he had practiced for the occasion. His men
shuffled slowly out of the room, some of them coughing
and others covertly wiping their eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mr. Dugald and Doctor Blackwell and Cap’n
Phin and Martie and Gran’ma Calkins remained.
Mart and Sidney were excitedly examining the little
slip of paper that meant five thousand whole dollars,
not with any coveting, for Mart was as vehement
as Sidney in disclaiming any share in the reward.
It was Lav’s. But for Lav’s risking everything to
swim to shore no one might have known anything
about Jed Starrow’s connection with the persistent
smuggling.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, where <i>is</i> Jed Starrow?” Sidney suddenly
asked and Cap’n Phin told her Jed Starrow was in
jail.</p>

<p class='c008' >“It’ll be a lesson to him and others like him,”
he continued, sternly. “Betrayin’ the honor of the
Cape! And him born and brought up on it!”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney felt a moment’s regret that <i>anyone</i> had
to be in jail. Then she forgot it in everyone’s interest
as to what Lavender would do with so much
money. They pressed him on every side, heedless of
Doctor Blackwell’s warning that the boy should not
be unduly excited.</p>

<p class='c008' >Lav’s eyes found Aunt Achsa’s smiling face.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Get Aunt Achsa an oil stove,” he answered
promptly. “And—and lots of things. And books.
And—” his eyes kindled. But he broke off abruptly.
He was going to say that now he could go to
school in one of the big cities where folks did not
notice other folks who were “different.” But he did
not say it, he did not want to spoil Aunt Achsa’s joy.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney understood and, reaching out, squeezed
one of Lavender’s hands.</p>

<p class='c008' >Doctor Blackwell ordered his patient back to bed.
Martie took Gran’ma Calkins home. With much
handshaking Cap’n Phin took his leave. Miss Letty
and Trude and Sidney briskly cleared away the dishes.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I feel as though I had lived ten years since I
heard those men pounding on Steve Blackwell’s door,”
declared Miss Letty, piling the plates with a clatter.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, ten! A <i>hundred</i>! I didn’t know anyone
<i>could</i> live so fast all at one time!” agreed Sidney
solemnly. “Sometimes I think I’m just dreaming
and will wake up and find that nothing’s happened.
I won’t mind going home now for I’ll have so much
to think about!”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Going home?” gasped Aunt Achsa. “Why—why—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Dugald Allan, coming from Lavender’s room,
interrupted them.</p>

<p class='c008' >“I beg to report that your millionaire nephew
is resting quietly and is in fine shape.” Sidney noticed
with a little glow of feeling how quickly Mr. Dugald’s
eyes sought Trude’s. And she thought Trude
cruel to look away!</p>

<p class='c008' >Miss Vine persuaded Aunt Achsa to go to bed
and then said good-night herself. Her “ten years”
had left her fatigued. Dugald Allan walked as far
as the lane with her then came back, remembering
suddenly that he was carrying two letters in his
pocket.</p>

<p class='c008' >“In the excitement I nearly forgot them,” he
apologized. He drew them out. Both were for
Trude and had been forwarded by special delivery
from Long Island. One was from Vick and one
from Issy.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, open them quickly,” begged Sidney.</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude’s hand trembled as she held Issy’s envelope.
“I’m—almost afraid to. I <i>know</i> it’s silly—but
so much has happened today that—I don’t think—I
could bear—anything more!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXV' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br />NO ONE LAUGHS LAST</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007' >Trude read Issy’s letter aloud, not noticing in
her high pitch of anxiety that Dugald Allan had
lingered.</p>

<p class='c008' >“—I am going to tell something now concerning
which I have given no hint in my former letters. It’s
something that means so much to me that I have
not dared write about it until it was decided. And
now it is decided. Professor Deering has asked
me to stay on with him as his secretary. And I have
accepted. The salary will not be so very big though it
will seem big to me and I am happy among books
and bookish people and working right here in the
college will give me opportunities I never had before.</p>

<p class='c008' >“But Trude dear, I feel like a deserter! To think
that I who used to preach the loudest of our duty to
Dad’s memory and the tradition of his genius should
be the first to break from it! I believe now that Sidney,
that morning she had her little flare-up and we
promised her the Egg, broke down restraints that
have been holding us all. Certainly, ever since then,
rebellious thoughts have been growing in me. I have
come to see our lives differently and to believe that
we’ve been silly. We thought we had to go on living
the same kind of lives we led when Dad was with
us, that we had to submerge our own personalities
to his because his was so great. Maybe the League
frightened us into thinking that; they bought us
or thought they did. But Trude, they <i>couldn’t</i>! They
can buy the house and the atmosphere and Dad’s
coat and chair and pens and all that but they can’t
buy Dad’s children! Dad wouldn’t want it that way.
Why, we are his greatest creation and our lives are
his gift to us and he would want us to make something
fine of those gifts—something that would be
our own. Sidney said that she wanted to be something
besides Joseph Romley’s daughter and that
was simply her real self crying for escape. I hope
the dear child has found it in a happy summer and
has had her fill of the adventure she craved.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Happy as I am I cannot bear thinking of leaving
you with the responsibilities of Vick and Sidney and
the League, except that you have always carried
the responsibility anyway. But it seems too
much for even shoulders like yours. So I’ve been
making schemes. Vick will be sure to marry soon,
bless her pretty face, and then with my salary and
the royalties we can send Sidney away to school and
you can plan something for yourself just as I have
done. It’s a wonderful feeling, Trude, I am just
beginning to live! I don’t mind a bit now thinking
of being an old maid—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Trude folded the letter, suddenly conscious of
her listeners. Sidney caught at it as though to make
certain it had actually been written by her sister
Isolde.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Think of it. Trude! A hope-to-die secretary
with a salary! I do believe it’s old Issy who’s going
to laugh last.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“What do you mean Sidney?” asked Trude; but
she did not wait for Sidney to answer. Her thoughts
were elsewhere. “I believe <i>Issy</i> has torn a veil from
us all. We <i>were</i> silly. We held to the ties of Dad
as a poet and were losing the sweet real ones of him
as a father. Of course he’d want us—the father
part of him—to live our own lives, make of them
what we can—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“<i>Would he?</i>” cried Dugald Allan from his corner.
And at the sound of his voice Trude started,
her face flushing crimson. “Then, Trude Romley,
will you please withdraw that answer you gave me
out on the breakwall? It can’t hold good now.”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, <i>hush</i>! Don’t! Not here—now—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney, alert to some deeper meaning, took up
his question.</p>

<p class='c008' >“What answer?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mr. Dugald threw his arm about her shoulder.
“Sid, I asked your sister to marry me. You see I
found out that you needed a big brother, someone
with a stern eye and a hard heart and I rather want
the job. And that’s the only way I can think of.
And she says she cannot, that she must keep the little
household together in return for what the League
has done and cook and sew and sweep and keep
accounts. I think there was a lot more—”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney threw out an imploring hand to her sister.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Oh, Trude, <i>please</i>! I <i>do</i> need a big brother.
And Mr. Dugald’s grand! And rich. Pola said so.
And <i>dear</i>. And it’d be such fun having him in the
family! I’ll go away to school and Vick can work
and we can give the old house over to the League.
Issy <i>said</i> they couldn’t buy us! And—why, there
are just loads of women trying to get Mr. Dugald—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“Sidney Romley, <i>stop</i>!” Trude stamped her
foot in confused exasperation. She refused to meet
Dugald’s yearning eyes.</p>

<p class='c008' >“No League can mortgage your heart or your
happiness!” he pleaded softly. “It belongs to you—to
give—”</p>

<p class='c008' >“I object to being courted in this—public—manner,”
Trude broke in, her hands flying to her
face. But Dugald Allan caught the surrender in her
eyes. He seized her hand.</p>

<p class='c008' >“All right. We’ll go out in the garden. Excuse
us, Sid. When I come back I think I’ll be your big
brother.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney’s eyes followed them longingly until they
disappeared behind a hedge of hollyhocks. She
wanted to laugh and to cry all at once she was so
strangely happy; her girl heart stirred with a vicarious
thrill to the look she had seen in Trude’s face.
Well, Trude would laugh last! Dear old Trude.
Trude a bride when everyone had thought that she
would never marry, just because she had no beaus
like Vick or languishing poets like Issy.</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney stood still in the center of the dusk gray
room. She did not know what she wanted to do next—or
even think of. She would like to plan the wedding
at once with herself as a beautiful bridesmaid
in shimmery white and Mart and Pola and Lavender
and Aunt Achsa there to see, and she would like just
to think of Mrs. Milliken’s face when she heard about
everything and—</p>

<p class='c008' >Suddenly her eyes fell upon Vick’s forgotten
letter. What had Vick written? No ordinary letter
could come on this momentous day! Perhaps Vick
had written that she had eloped—she had read that
sometimes even nice girls did that, girls oppressed by
things like the League. She opened the letter without
any hesitation and carried it to the door that
she might read it by the fading light.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was not neatly margined like Issy’s; the big
letters raced slantwise across the page. Nor was
it wordy, rather straight to the point.</p>

<p class='c008' >“Dear old girls everybody: You’ll die. Godmother
Jocelyn’s a good sort, in spite of her lace
and her lap-dog. She’s going to take me around
the world! She says that as long as we’re this far
we might as well go all the way. It isn’t the cherry
blossoms and the rickshaws and the southern moons
alone that thrill me—we’re going with the peppiest
family from Chicago—some people we met on the
train. A father, a mother, a girl my age—<i>AND</i>—a
very nice brother! <i>Nicest yet!</i> But am I a pig?
Yes. To leave my sisters there under Mrs. Milliken’s
thumb! But you’ll forgive me, won’t you? Do you
remember how we used to play going to China?<i> And
I’m going!</i>”</p>

<p class='c008' >Sidney drew a long breath. She wished she were
not alone. She wanted to shout or something.
“Well!” she cried softly. “<i>No</i> one laughs loudest!
I guess—the whole family of Romley—laughs
<i>together</i> long—and—loud!”</p>
